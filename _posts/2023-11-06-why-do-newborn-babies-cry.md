Why Do Newborn Babies Cry?

If your baby is crying, they are trying to tell you something. But what could they be saying?

They might be hungry!

Calm babies may squirm and become fussy rather than cry when they're hungry. If your baby falls into the calm baby category, you might observe this reaction. However, remember that your baby's way of expressing hunger is usually through crying! In response to the question of why newborn babies cry at night, hunger is a common answer. Of course, there are other answers to the question of how to tell if a newborn is hungry.

They might be uncomfortable!

Things that may make your baby uncomfortable include:

- A wet or soiled diaper
- Gas and indigestion issues
- Feeling too cold or too hot
- Wearing itchy clothing

Why would a well-fed and clean baby cry? Most likely, your baby is feeling bored, lonely, and frightened. That's why they may be crying to hear your voice, feel your touch, and be in your arms.

They might be tired and sleep-deprived!

An overly tired and sleep-deprived baby will cry. Babies are expected to sleep for up to 16 hours a day, and when they can't sleep, they become fussy and cry. Excessive noise and visual stimulation can also lead to crying.

Understanding Newborn Baby Crying: What Should You Look For?

What do your baby's cries indicate from the reasons mentioned above? Here are a few simple clues:

- If they cry because they're hungry, they may move their lips and search for the breast.
- Pain-related crying is sudden and high-pitched.
- If they rub their eyes, they may be sleepy.
- If they cry after a noise, they may be scared.

How Long Does Newborn Baby Crying Last?

On average, a newborn baby may cry for 1 to 4 hours a day.

What Should You Do When Your Newborn Baby Cries?

- Check their diaper and see if they're hungry.
- Ensure that their diaper is dry and clean before investigating whether they're hungry. Comforting your baby may be necessary before attempting to feed them.

- Check their body temperature.
- Are their hands and feet cold? Do they seem sweaty and uncomfortable? After answering these questions, you may need to either dress your baby in something new or remove some layers. A lukewarm bath for your baby might also be a good idea. This way, you'll not only calm them but also make them feel more comfortable.

- Use soothing words.
- You can speak calmly and gently. These sounds remind your baby of the noises they heard while in the womb, helping them feel better. While talking to your baby in their crib, you can also try stroking them.

- Encourage them to nurse.
- Your baby has a strong need to suck. You can soothe them by allowing them to suck not only on your breast but also on your finger. Sucking regulates your baby's pulse and relaxes their stomach muscles.

- Hold them!
- If they continue to cry in their crib, the best thing you can do to stop them from crying is to hold them. They will calm down when they feel your heartbeat and smell. During this time, you can gently stroke their belly and back or lie down with them for skin-to-skin contact.

- Gently rock them!
- When you pick up your baby and gently rock them, they'll feel like they're in your belly again and calm down. You can continue rocking your baby using a baby carriage, baby carrier, or parent's arm. 

- Help them hear soothing sounds!
- There are many sounds that remind your baby of the womb, known as white noise. Some of these include the sounds of a vacuum cleaner, washing machine, and hair dryer. You can let your baby hear these machine sounds to calm them. You can also play soothing music for babies, created by nature, such as the sound of the sea. It will not only be more pleasant for you than the sound of a vacuum cleaner but also help your baby feel better!

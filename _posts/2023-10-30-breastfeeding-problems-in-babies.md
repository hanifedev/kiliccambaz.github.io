# Breastfeeding Strike: My Baby Won't Nurse - Causes and Solutions

## First, Let's Understand: What Is Breastfeeding Strike?

Breastfeeding strike refers to the situation where a baby refuses to nurse for various reasons. There are several factors that can lead to breastfeeding refusal in babies, and various methods to address this issue.

## Thrush

Thrush is a common oral infection in babies. If your baby has thrush, they may refuse to nurse. This condition requires treatment and following your doctor's recommendations.

## Nasal Congestion

When your baby experiences nasal congestion due to illnesses such as a cold, flu, or allergies, it can make nursing difficult. In such cases, they might refuse to breastfeed. It's essential to follow your doctor's advice to relieve nasal congestion.

## Ear Infection

If your baby has an ear infection caused by feverish illnesses, colds, or improper cleaning, they may refuse to nurse due to the pain in their ears. In this situation, consult your doctor for prompt assistance.

## Teething

During the teething period (around 5-10 months), babies may experience gum sensitivity, pain, and discomfort. Consequently, it's normal for them to refuse nursing during this time. To alleviate teething-related nursing issues, you can use cold teething toys, sensitivity-reducing gels recommended by your doctor, and mild pain relievers if your baby has a fever.

## Forceful Milk Flow

An excessively rapid milk flow can fill your baby's mouth, making it difficult for them to swallow comfortably. Regulating milk flow and choosing appropriate nursing positions can help address this issue.

## Incorrect Latch

Using the wrong nursing position, especially for newborns, can result in an incorrect latch, making it challenging for your baby to nurse. If your baby is making clicking noises while nursing and not taking the entire areola into their mouth, it's an indication of an incorrect position.

## Maternal Diet

Consuming spicy, pungent, or highly seasoned foods and making changes to your diet can affect the taste of your breast milk. If your baby doesn't like the new taste, they may refuse to nurse. If this is the case, consider expressing some milk before nursing and then attempting breastfeeding again.

## Food Allergies

Certain foods like cow's milk, strawberries, tomatoes, and eggs can cause allergies in your baby, leading to skin reactions and possibly reflux. If your baby faces these issues, they may refuse to nurse. To encourage breastfeeding, you should exclude potential allergenic foods from your diet.

## Baby's Reflux

Reflux can cause your baby's stomach acid to rise, leading to spitting up and sometimes even vomiting. If your baby is suffering from reflux, they may refuse to nurse, especially when lying flat on their back. Be cautious not to overfeed your baby and consider using reflux pillows to address this issue.

## Maternal Pregnancy

If you become pregnant while still breastfeeding, the change in hormones can alter the taste of your milk. As a result, your baby might refuse to nurse during this period.

## Maternal Mood

If you attempt to nurse your baby when you're feeling angry or stressed, your baby will likely pick up on your mood and become agitated, leading to nursing refusal. Therefore, it's essential to calm down and create a peaceful environment for nursing.

## Bottle Habit

Babies who have become accustomed to bottle feeding, often due to factors such as maternal employment, may reject the breast. In such cases, it might take time and patience to transition them back to breastfeeding.

## Changes in Nursing Schedule

If you've made changes to your baby's nursing schedule after establishing a routine, they might resist and refuse to nurse. Babies, especially those older than six months, may have difficulty letting go of established patterns.

## Distractions

Babies generally prefer quiet and one-on-one environments for nursing. Background noise and unfamiliar faces can distract them and hinder their nursing. To address this, aim for a quiet and peaceful nursing environment.

## Tongue Tie

Tongue tie refers to a piece of tissue that secures the tongue to the bottom of the mouth. Sometimes, this tissue can be shorter or thicker than usual, affecting the baby's ability to move their tongue and latch onto the breast correctly. In such cases, your baby may become exhausted when trying to nurse, leading to nursing refusal.

## How to Prevent Breast Refusal

As mentioned above, various factors can contribute to breast refusal, and the solutions depend on the underlying causes. Here are some methods to help prevent breast refusal:

- Nurse your baby on demand.
- Limit the use of bottles and pacifiers.
- Create a quiet and peaceful nursing environment.
- Be observant of your baby's physical changes and address any issues promptly.

## What Can a 4-Month-Old Baby Do?

Your baby's skills begin to diversify gradually. By the end of the fourth month, they may exhibit the following behaviors:

- They can raise their chest with the support of their arms and hands while lying on their stomach.
- When placed on their stomach, they can lift their head at a 90-degree angle.

### What to Consider When Choosing Toys

When choosing toys for a 4-month-old baby, consider the following factors:

- The toy should not easily break or come apart. If it does, there's a risk of your baby swallowing small parts.
- Select toys and items that your baby can grasp, shake, and manipulate to practice their motor skills.
- Opt for toys that are easy to clean.
- Choose toys that are larger than your baby's fist to avoid choking hazards.
- Avoid toys with strings, which could be a choking hazard.
- Soft, gentle-sounding toys are recommended, as loud noises can be disturbing to your baby's hearing.

## What You Can Do for Your 4-Month-Old Baby's Development

Here are some things you can do to support your 4-month-old baby's development:

- Observe the movements your baby makes during the fourth month and smile at them. You can talk to your baby about the toys they are playing with and provide information. You can even talk to your baby about what you see around you. This can help speed up language development. Even though they can't speak yet, they will continue to store everything you say in their head.
- To support their sensory development, provide toys with different colors and soft, gentle sounds. It's a great idea to choose soft-sounding rattles, as your baby can easily manipulate them. You can observe their reactions and development by playing with the toy. Moreover, it's an activity they can do on their own.
- Turn bath time with your baby into a fun game. Allowing your baby to stay in the water longer can help them enjoy it.
- When playing with your baby, try to make them smile. Your baby might laugh frequently. It's a special period in their development when unusual or funny things make them laugh.
- When your baby begins to learn to sit, you can help support them in sitting up. This helps develop their sense of balance and strengthens their back muscles.
- You can encourage your baby's physical and muscle development by doing exercises with them. Moving their body helps with physical and muscle development. For example, while they are lying down, you can place their hands over their head and bring them down. Or you can bend and bring their legs toward their stomach and then pull them back. If your baby becomes fussy, you can try different things.

## Feeding Your 4-Month-Old Baby

In the fourth month, the easiest hours to breastfeed your baby are when they are in a sleepy state. If your baby's height and weight are good for their age and your doctor approves, you should continue with breast milk. Your baby should be fed 4 or 5 times a day.

## Important Notes About Your 4-Month-Old Baby

### Teething in Your Baby

# Things to Pay Attention to in Your Baby's First 6 Months

## Introduction
If you're a new parent, most of your questions may revolve around your baby's nutrition. You might wonder, "How much should my baby weigh? Should I wake up a sleeping baby for breastfeeding at night? Why does my baby constantly want to nurse? When can my baby start solid foods?" We understand that you have these questions, and in this guide, we will provide you with essential information on what to focus on during your baby's first 6 months.

## Feeding Schedule
During the first 6 months, it is recommended to exclusively breastfeed your baby if possible. In the absence of breast milk, you can consult your doctor and consider using formula milk. Other than breast milk or formula, you should not introduce any other foods to your baby during this period (including water or fruit juice).

Every baby is unique, but one consistent fact is that breastfed babies get hungry more quickly compared to formula-fed babies. This is because breast milk is easily digestible and empties from the stomach much faster than formula milk. Therefore, it is natural for your baby to want to nurse frequently during the first months.

Your baby's stomach size changes as they grow: It is cherry-sized at birth, walnut-sized by day 3, apricot-sized at the end of the first week, and egg-sized at the end of the second week. You can gauge whether your baby is satisfied by consistently weighing them and monitoring their daily wet diapers.

## Sleep Routine
### 0-3 Months
During this period, your baby can sleep well in your arms with skin-to-skin contact. Creating a calming environment that resembles the warmth, love, and conditions of the womb will comfort your baby. This can be achieved through your scent, gentle rocking, frequent nursing, swaddling to mimic the snug womb environment, and using white noise that mimics womb sounds.

### 4-6 Months
Babies grow rapidly during this stage, nearing the end of the newborn phase and beginning to adapt to the world. It's important for your baby to gradually establish sleep routines, avoiding habits that you may have to break later on. These habits could include rocking, car rides, baby carriers, and constant carrying.

You can gradually reduce practices like rocking and white noise that you implemented during the first 3 months. Consistency and emotional support throughout this process will yield positive results.

Sleep is as crucial as nutrition for your baby's development. Regardless of their age, babies require a calming routine for sleep to feel secure. While every baby is unique, many babies enjoy a pre-sleep bath and find it soothing. You can incorporate bath time into your baby's bedtime routine.

## Diaper Changes
Learning to change your baby's diaper and getting accustomed to it may take some time. Initially, you may be concerned about hurting your baby or making a mistake. However, with practice, you will become more confident in performing these tasks.

It is essential to prioritize your baby's sensitive skin when choosing diapers and wet wipes. Uni Baby Newborn Wet Wipes, the first and only newborn wipe approved for naturalness in Turkey, with its 100% natural fibers and pure water content, gently cleanses your newborn's skin without irritation.

## Umbilical Cord Care
To promote quick healing of the umbilical cord, ensure it stays dry. Instead of direct washing, consider sponge baths for your baby in the early days. Keeping the umbilical cord exposed outside of the diaper can also help.

It is no longer recommended to use alcohol for cleaning the umbilical cord, in line with the World Health Organization's guidelines. This approach allows the umbilical cord to dry faster.

## Bathing Routine
You can sponge bathe your newborn for the first few weeks. This is the safest way to clean your baby before the umbilical cord falls off.

After the umbilical cord heals, you can give your baby a bath in water. Initially, keep bath times short. Your baby might protest during the first few baths, but they will usually signal when they are ready.

For your baby's sensitive skin, ensure that the products you use are hypoallergenic. Uni Baby Newborn Foam Shampoo and Body Wash can be applied gently to your baby with its formula containing 95% natural ingredients and pure water.

## Skin Care
A baby's skin is delicate and prone to allergies. It's crucial to choose hypoallergenic products for your baby. To protect your baby's sensitive skin, follow these recommendations:

- Change your baby's diaper frequently and consider using diaper rash creams.
- Avoid overheating your baby. (Babies often have cold hands and feet, but you can tell if they are too cold by feeling their neck.)
- If your baby's skin becomes dry, you can moisturize it with Uni Baby's baby oils.
- Opt for clothing and bedding made of cotton.
- Wash clothing that comes into prolonged contact with your baby's skin with specialized products designed for sensitive and breathable fabrics. Uni Baby Newborn Liquid Laundry Detergent offers a natural formula that leaves no soap residue on your baby's delicate clothes.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your baby's first 6 months are as comfortable and healthy as possible. Your baby's well-being and comfort are a top priority, and these practices will help you provide the best care for your little one.

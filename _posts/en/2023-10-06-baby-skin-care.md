## Protect Your Baby from the Sun

Newborn baby skin is quite sensitive. Compared to an adult, a baby's skin is thinner and has less natural oil, making it prone to issues like dryness, flaking, and peeling when exposed to dry air or sunlight. So, if you're wondering, "How can I protect my baby's skin from the sun?" follow these steps:

- Keep your baby out of the sun as much as possible, even in winter.
- If your baby is under 6 months old, avoid using sunscreen.
- Ensure your baby stays in the shade.
- Use a hat to cover your baby's neck and ears.
- Dress your baby in loose, lightweight clothing that covers their arms and legs.
- Avoid exposing your baby to the sun during the peak hours of UV radiation, which is between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, if possible.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding sunscreen use for babies under 6 months old and using sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15 for older children.

## Keep Your Baby's Skin Moisturized

Newborns often experience skin dryness. Due to their time spent in a liquid environment in the womb and their adjustment to the dry air of the world, babies may develop dry skin. Additionally, their ability to retain moisture is not fully developed, which can lead to dryness, flaking, and peeling.

To prevent dryness in your baby's skin, you can use water-based baby oil or baby lotion as recommended by your doctor. It's advisable to repeat this process daily. If you're wondering whether you can use olive oil to moisturize your baby's skin, the answer is no, as olive oil is acidic.

When choosing baby skincare products (baby shampoo, baby soap, baby lotion, baby cream, baby detergent, etc.), opt for products specifically formulated for babies that are gentle, fragrance-free, and designed to be gentle on the skin.

## Bathing Your Baby

Another important aspect of baby skincare is determining how often to bathe your baby. Due to their sensitive skin and inability to regulate oil production effectively, newborns do not need to be bathed daily. It is recommended to bathe your baby no more than three times a week during the first year. Instead, you can gently clean your baby's neck and joints daily with a damp cloth or cotton.

Using hot water during baths can lead to excessive drying of your baby's skin. Therefore, use lukewarm water for your baby's bath, and opt for baby skincare products that are specially formulated, fragrance-free, and pH-balanced to maintain your baby's skin moisture.

## Choosing the Right Diaper

Selecting the right diaper is crucial for protecting your baby's skin, ensuring a good night's sleep, and allowing comfortable movement. The choice of diaper can impact your baby's skin pH balance, which may lead to diaper rash. Therefore, when choosing a diaper:

- Opt for diapers with high absorbency that lock in moisture.
- Choose diapers designed with air channels and materials that allow the skin to breathe.
- Select soft and thin diapers.
- Follow the recommendations of pediatricians.
- Prefer a brand developed in collaboration with experts.

Also, pay attention to proper diaper changing hygiene to prevent diaper rash. Avoid using alcohol-based or perfumed wet wipes, and opt for wet wipes that are free from alcohol and parabens, dermatologically tested, pH-balanced to preserve the natural skin barrier, and contain plant-based fibers for gentle cleansing.

## Taking Care of Baby's Umbilical Cord

The baby's umbilical cord typically falls off within two weeks after birth. To prevent infection and ensure proper care of the umbilical cord, follow these guidelines:

- Allow the diaper to fold down below the umbilical area.
- Ensure some air circulation by occasionally lifting the baby's clothing.
- Keep the area dry.

## Selecting Baby Clothes Carefully

Choosing the right baby clothing is crucial for preventing skin irritation. To keep your baby's sensitive skin comfortable and irritation-free, consider the following when selecting baby clothes, blankets, and sheets:

- Opt for soft, 100% cotton materials that don't cause irritation.
- Choose seasonally appropriate clothing.
- Select clothing that allows your baby to move comfortably.
- Avoid clothing with excessive embellishments like feathers, lace, labels, or embroidery.
- Examine seams for rough edges or excessive thickness.

Remember that baby skincare is essential for your baby's healthy growth. Be mindful of the ingredients in skincare products and protect your baby from the sun, especially during the summer months. Choose clothing that is appropriate for your baby's size and season, and avoid over-bathing your baby. Keeping these practices in mind will help ensure your baby's skin stays healthy and comfortable.

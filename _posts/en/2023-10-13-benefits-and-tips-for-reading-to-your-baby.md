# Why Is Reading to Your Baby Important?

Reading to babies is often considered an unnecessary activity by many parents. There is a misconception that babies won't understand what they hear during this process and that it won't stay in their memories.

However, it's crucial to know that all the sensory stimuli surrounding the baby, including sounds, smells, tastes, colors, shapes, and touch, begin to imprint on their brains from the moment they are born. Stimulated brain cells interact with each other, forming various connections. These connections actually lay the foundation for your baby's brain capacity throughout their life.

Additionally, there are other benefits to reading to babies. Let's take a look at them:

- It helps your baby enjoy quality time with you.
- Regular reading, especially after meals or before bedtime, can soothe and relax your baby.
- It's a great way for fathers to bond with their babies. While a father may not breastfeed, reading with a soft voice while holding the baby can establish a connection.
- Your baby learns to listen.
- Words spoken loudly and repeatedly contribute to your baby's language acquisition.
- Watching you while you read helps your baby learn facial expressions and mimic them.
- Making book reading a routine can make it easier for your baby to continue this habit as they grow.
- In the long run, it fosters imagination, creativity, and a broader vocabulary.
- Picture books aid in the development of your child's visual memory.

# When Should You Start Reading to Your Baby?

You can begin reading to your baby from around the 6th month. The 6th month is a significant milestone in your baby's development. By this time, your baby can hold their head up, sit comfortably in your lap, and their attention span has improved, making it an ideal time to start reading.

# What to Consider When Choosing Baby Books?

When choosing the first book for your baby, it should have thick pages, short sentences, and minimal text.

Baby books should be colorful with simple and uncluttered illustrations.

The content should be age-appropriate, avoiding concepts that your baby won't understand.

It should contain concrete but meaningful expressions, making baby stories a good choice.

Texture and tactile elements like raised surfaces or textures (e.g., felt books) can be appealing.

# Tips for Reading to Your Baby

- Choose the right time for reading. For example, a suitable time could be when your baby's belly is full, their diaper is clean, and they are comfortable.
- While reading, avoid multitasking both physically and mentally. Activities like answering the phone and thinking about dinner can disrupt your baby's concentration.
- Pay attention to whether your baby is getting bored. If they become disinterested, it's time to stop.
- Encourage your baby to look at the pictures and say what they are.
- When explaining the pictures, use your finger to point.
- While reading the book, use your body and voice in line with the images. For example, if a dog is barking in the book, bark in a similar way.
- Allow your baby to hold the book, put it in their mouth, and turn the pages. Help them explore and get familiar with the book.
- If there's a page that seems to catch their attention, spend extra time discussing it.
- Let your baby make choices. Show them different books and let them pick.
- You can also read rhymes, songs, and lullabies. They are attractive to your baby because they contain repetitive sounds and have a rhythm.
- Be patient and keep reading the same story even if it gets boring for you. It's a fun activity for your baby.
- Your baby's age, motor development, cognitive development, and your actions will influence your reading experiences.

# Baby's Reactions to Reading at Different Ages

- **6-12 months:** Reach for the book and grasp it. Sit upright in your lap. With adult assistance, they may turn the pages. They look at pictures and might prefer faces.
- **12-18 months:** Can sit unsupported, carry the book, and turn pages. They may not immediately put everything in their mouths. Point at images and make sounds. They can turn the pages in the correct direction.
- **18-24 months:** They carry the book, and you may find them offering it to you. They may recognize familiar pictures. If asked, they can point to figures. Their attention span varies and may be short.
- **24-36 months:** They can find favorite pictures in the book and flip back and forth between pages. They may memorize all the words in the book and associate pictures with what they hear. They may form an attachment to a particular book. Let them choose, and even if it gets repetitive for you, continue reading. Encourage them to ask questions.

Remember, reading to your baby is not only beneficial for their development but also a wonderful bonding experience between you and your little one.

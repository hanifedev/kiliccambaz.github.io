# Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby

Congratulations, you've completed the first month with your baby! The second month promises to be more relaxed and experienced. Your baby's sleep patterns are beginning to form, they'll become more active, and you might even witness their first smile. Let's explore what to expect in terms of feeding frequency, sleep routines, and the behavior of your 2-month-old baby, along with their sensory development.

## 2-Month-Old Baby Growth Chart

During the second month, your baby will continue to gain weight at a similar rate to the first few weeks, typically around 150 to 200 grams per week. Their cheeks, arms, and legs will start to fill out gradually. While the average weight for a 2-month-old baby is 4-5 kg, remember that each healthy baby may have different growth rates in terms of size and weight. The baby's height may increase by approximately 1-1.5 cm per month.

The head and brain of your baby continue to develop at the same rate. The head circumference increases by about 1.25 cm per month. It's normal for the baby's head to be larger than other body parts during this period, as the head continues to grow faster than other organs. The baby's soft spot on the skull (fontanel) remains open but starts to harden and close slightly toward the end of the second month and the beginning of the third month.

## Sensory Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby

### Vision at 2 Months

In the second month, your baby's vision becomes clearer and more vibrant compared to the previous month. You can now introduce them to pastel colors. Their improved vision means they will show more interest in bright and vivid colors. They will also examine your movements and speech with their eyes, so you might notice them vocalizing as a result. However, these sounds will consist of voiced consonants, as they have not yet mastered using their tongue for speech. This is completely normal, as babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age.

### Hearing at 2 Months

In the second month, your baby's hearing becomes stronger than in the previous month. They will likely perceive your voice more clearly. You can even notice them becoming concerned if they don't hear your voice for an extended period. They can distinguish between high-pitched and low-pitched sounds. For instance, they can differentiate between your voice and their father's voice. You can gauge their responses by playing the same familiar melodies or reading the same story repeatedly. Since their hearing has improved, they will produce more sounds. Although these sounds will be mainly voiced consonants, there's nothing to worry about. Babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age.

### Sense of Smell at 2 Months

Your baby has been exposed to various scents since birth, such as the smell of breast milk, your perfume, or the aroma of cooked chicken. As long as they don't show sensitivity to smells, you can introduce them to other scents.

### Sense of Taste at 2 Months

At this stage, there's no need to stimulate your baby's sense of taste. They can only detect the taste of mother's milk and bottle milk during this period. As they grow, exploring and tasting everything they find will become their way of researching the world. As long as these objects are not sharp or dangerous, it's best not to intervene.

### Sense of Touch at 2 Months

The sense of touch is one of the most meaningful senses your baby uses to explore the world and understand how they should be touched. Try to understand how your baby prefers to be touched. Many babies enjoy being kissed, cuddled, or having their tummies tickled. There's nothing better than hands filled with love. Expose your baby to different fabric textures and place them on different surfaces while lying on their stomach. Give them a massage for at least 20 minutes. Babies who receive massages gain weight more quickly and show better development. Infants who are not touched enough may experience growth delays.

## Mental Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby

So far, your baby has been listening to and absorbing the conversations and sounds around them. Although they can't vocalize their thoughts yet, they started understanding the meanings of words months before they began speaking. So, talk to your baby as much as possible. Look forward to those cooing and babbling sounds, which usually start between the 6th and 8th weeks. Your baby will eventually use their lips more effectively to create clearer sounds. This development in their tongue goes hand in hand with their motor skills.

## Social Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby

Your baby will still spend most of their time sleeping. However, a 6-week-old baby can respond to your smiles with smiles in return. Responding positively to their smiles will help them realize that their actions have an effect, thus developing their ability to distinguish themselves from others.

### What Can a 2-Month-Old Baby Do?

- They can lift their body at a 45-degree angle when placed on their stomach. By the middle of this month, they may even lift their head at a 90-degree angle.
- They start to explore and play with their hands.
- They often engage with their hands and feet.
- When an object is placed in front of them or given to them, they can begin to grasp it. They may attempt to bring small objects to their mouths and shake larger objects.
- They can't completely control their body movements yet, so it's important not to leave them unattended on high surfaces.
- They sleep less during the day and more at night.
- They find joy in hearing their own voice and will make sounds frequently.
- They can smile and make joyful cries.
- They understand when they are being paid attention to.
- They enjoy making sounds more than ever.
- They can clearly recognize their mother's voice.
- They might even squeal with happiness.
- Sucking can help calm them.
- When they cry, especially when you hold them, they can calm down.

### Toys for a 2-Month-Old Baby

Since your baby will stay awake for longer periods, they will benefit from simple, safe, and colorful toys that help them improve their hand-eye coordination. Here are some suitable toys:

- Rattles: These are great for stimulating your baby's sense of hearing.
- Mobiles: Hanging mobiles with colorful and contrasting objects can grab your baby's attention.
- Soft Toys: Soft, plush toys with different textures can be comforting and engaging.
- Play Mats: These have hanging toys that encourage reaching and swatting.
- Mirror Toys: Babies are fascinated by their own reflection.
- Black and White Books: These high-contrast books are visually stimulating for infants.
- Sensory Balls: Soft balls with textures for tactile stimulation.

Remember that at this age, your baby will primarily enjoy looking at, listening to, and touching toys rather than actively playing with them. Keep safety in mind when selecting toys, ensuring there are no small parts that could be a choking hazard.

## Conclusion

The second month of your baby's life is a period of rapid development, both physically and mentally. They are becoming more alert, responsive, and interactive. As a parent, continue to provide love, care, and attention to support their growth and well-being. Every baby is unique, so be sure to consult with your pediatrician if you have any specific concerns about your baby's development.

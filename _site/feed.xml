<h2 id="first-lets-understand-what-is-breastfeeding-strike">First, Let’s Understand: What Is Breastfeeding Strike?</h2>

<p>Breastfeeding strike refers to the situation where a baby refuses to nurse for various reasons. There are several factors that can lead to breastfeeding refusal in babies, and various methods to address this issue.</p>

<h2 id="thrush">Thrush</h2>

<p>Thrush is a common oral infection in babies. If your baby has thrush, they may refuse to nurse. This condition requires treatment and following your doctor’s recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="nasal-congestion">Nasal Congestion</h2>

<p>When your baby experiences nasal congestion due to illnesses such as a cold, flu, or allergies, it can make nursing difficult. In such cases, they might refuse to breastfeed. It’s essential to follow your doctor’s advice to relieve nasal congestion.</p>

<h2 id="ear-infection">Ear Infection</h2>

<p>If your baby has an ear infection caused by feverish illnesses, colds, or improper cleaning, they may refuse to nurse due to the pain in their ears. In this situation, consult your doctor for prompt assistance.</p>

<h2 id="teething">Teething</h2>

<p>During the teething period (around 5-10 months), babies may experience gum sensitivity, pain, and discomfort. Consequently, it’s normal for them to refuse nursing during this time. To alleviate teething-related nursing issues, you can use cold teething toys, sensitivity-reducing gels recommended by your doctor, and mild pain relievers if your baby has a fever.</p>

<h2 id="forceful-milk-flow">Forceful Milk Flow</h2>

<p>An excessively rapid milk flow can fill your baby’s mouth, making it difficult for them to swallow comfortably. Regulating milk flow and choosing appropriate nursing positions can help address this issue.</p>

<h2 id="incorrect-latch">Incorrect Latch</h2>

<p>Using the wrong nursing position, especially for newborns, can result in an incorrect latch, making it challenging for your baby to nurse. If your baby is making clicking noises while nursing and not taking the entire areola into their mouth, it’s an indication of an incorrect position.</p>

<h2 id="maternal-diet">Maternal Diet</h2>

<p>Consuming spicy, pungent, or highly seasoned foods and making changes to your diet can affect the taste of your breast milk. If your baby doesn’t like the new taste, they may refuse to nurse. If this is the case, consider expressing some milk before nursing and then attempting breastfeeding again.</p>

<h2 id="food-allergies">Food Allergies</h2>

<p>Certain foods like cow’s milk, strawberries, tomatoes, and eggs can cause allergies in your baby, leading to skin reactions and possibly reflux. If your baby faces these issues, they may refuse to nurse. To encourage breastfeeding, you should exclude potential allergenic foods from your diet.</p>

<h2 id="babys-reflux">Baby’s Reflux</h2>

<p>Reflux can cause your baby’s stomach acid to rise, leading to spitting up and sometimes even vomiting. If your baby is suffering from reflux, they may refuse to nurse, especially when lying flat on their back. Be cautious not to overfeed your baby and consider using reflux pillows to address this issue.</p>

<h2 id="maternal-pregnancy">Maternal Pregnancy</h2>

<p>If you become pregnant while still breastfeeding, the change in hormones can alter the taste of your milk. As a result, your baby might refuse to nurse during this period.</p>

<h2 id="maternal-mood">Maternal Mood</h2>

<p>If you attempt to nurse your baby when you’re feeling angry or stressed, your baby will likely pick up on your mood and become agitated, leading to nursing refusal. Therefore, it’s essential to calm down and create a peaceful environment for nursing.</p>

<h2 id="bottle-habit">Bottle Habit</h2>

<p>Babies who have become accustomed to bottle feeding, often due to factors such as maternal employment, may reject the breast. In such cases, it might take time and patience to transition them back to breastfeeding.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-nursing-schedule">Changes in Nursing Schedule</h2>

<p>If you’ve made changes to your baby’s nursing schedule after establishing a routine, they might resist and refuse to nurse. Babies, especially those older than six months, may have difficulty letting go of established patterns.</p>

<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>

<p>Babies generally prefer quiet and one-on-one environments for nursing. Background noise and unfamiliar faces can distract them and hinder their nursing. To address this, aim for a quiet and peaceful nursing environment.</p>

<h2 id="tongue-tie">Tongue Tie</h2>

<p>Tongue tie refers to a piece of tissue that secures the tongue to the bottom of the mouth. Sometimes, this tissue can be shorter or thicker than usual, affecting the baby’s ability to move their tongue and latch onto the breast correctly. In such cases, your baby may become exhausted when trying to nurse, leading to nursing refusal.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-breast-refusal">How to Prevent Breast Refusal</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, various factors can contribute to breast refusal, and the solutions depend on the underlying causes. Here are some methods to help prevent breast refusal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nurse your baby on demand.</li>
  <li>Limit the use of bottles and pacifiers.</li>
  <li>Create a quiet and peaceful nursing environment.</li>
  <li>Be observant of your baby’s physical changes and address any issues promptly.</li>

<h2 id="what-you-can-do-for-your-4-month-old-babys-development">What You Can Do for Your 4-Month-Old Baby’s Development</h2>

<p>Here are some things you can do to support your 4-month-old baby’s development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observe the movements your baby makes during the fourth month and smile at them. You can talk to your baby about the toys they are playing with and provide information. You can even talk to your baby about what you see around you. This can help speed up language development. Even though they can’t speak yet, they will continue to store everything you say in their head.</li>
  <li>To support their sensory development, provide toys with different colors and soft, gentle sounds. It’s a great idea to choose soft-sounding rattles, as your baby can easily manipulate them. You can observe their reactions and development by playing with the toy. Moreover, it’s an activity they can do on their own.</li>
  <li>Turn bath time with your baby into a fun game. Allowing your baby to stay in the water longer can help them enjoy it.</li>
  <li>When playing with your baby, try to make them smile. Your baby might laugh frequently. It’s a special period in their development when unusual or funny things make them laugh.</li>
  <li>When your baby begins to learn to sit, you can help support them in sitting up. This helps develop their sense of balance and strengthens their back muscles.</li>
  <li>You can encourage your baby’s physical and muscle development by doing exercises with them. Moving their body helps with physical and muscle development. For example, while they are lying down, you can place their hands over their head and bring them down. Or you can bend and bring their legs toward their stomach and then pull them back. If your baby becomes fussy, you can try different things.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feeding-your-4-month-old-baby">Feeding Your 4-Month-Old Baby</h2>

<p>As your baby grows and starts making more conscious movements in their childhood, you can list the benefits of having pets as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Awareness of Animals and Nature:</strong> Your baby gets the opportunity to see that there are beings other than humans, and these beings have different relationships with nature. This can help your baby develop respect for others and learn how to build good relationships from a very young age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Understanding Others’ Feelings:</strong> Your baby is already understanding your feelings. However, by looking into the eyes of a non-speaking and helpless pet, your baby can gain the skill to feel the pet’s discomfort and excitement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In this regard, spending time with animals can have a positive impact on your baby’s ability to understand the feelings of others in later life.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Taking Responsibility and Unconditional Love:</strong> When your child helps with the care and maintenance of the pet, they realize that they can meet someone else’s needs and experience love. This is essential for your child’s self-confidence.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="three-things-to-consider-before-adopting-a-pet">Three Things to Consider Before Adopting a Pet</h1>

<p>We talked about the benefits of your baby growing up with a pet. However, raising a child with a pet is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of getting a pet, we recommend making your decision by considering the following questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is Your Child Comfortable with Animals?</strong></p>

    <p>Observe if your child is comfortable around animals. It’s recommended to monitor your child’s behavior in the homes of friends who have pets instead of on the street.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do You Have Enough Space for Both?</strong></p>

    <p>As your child grows, their belongings will spread throughout the house, and every area of the house will become a play area for them. Special places that you don’t want them to touch, like drawers and cabinets, will become their center of attention.</p>

    <p>Adding an animal to this household may increase the chaos, so be sure to decide whether your home is suitable for both.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do You Have Time for Both?</strong></p>

    <p>In addition to the time you need to dedicate to your child, you will need time to take care of the pet. If you have a dog, you need to walk it outside. If you have a cat, you need to change the litter. Most importantly, you need to be prepared for dealing with your pet’s moods and emotions when you are not tending to your child.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-type-of-pet-to-choose">What Type of Pet to Choose?</h1>

<p>When choosing a pet to coexist with your child, you need to consider a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choose Calm Breeds for a Friendly Relationship:</strong> Crossbreeds are generally more patient and calm compared to purebred animals. You can use this preference as a general guideline. However, beyond the breed’s characteristics, you should also consider the specific qualities of the pet you want to adopt. Before comparing it to your child, it might be helpful to learn about the animal’s nature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Male or Female?</strong></p>

    <p>In general, female dogs are considered calmer than males. So, when planning for dogs and babies to coexist, you may prefer a female dog. On the other hand, male cats are usually calmer than females. Keep in mind that when your child and cat are together, trimming the cat’s claws can be useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Puppy or Adult?</strong></p>

    <p>You should also consider the age of the animal. If you plan to have a cat or dog at home with your baby, you may prefer a puppy or a young animal for them to grow up together and form a special bond.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="introducing-your-pet-to-your-baby">Introducing Your Pet to Your Baby</h1>

<p>It might be a good idea to train your pet to be well-behaved around your baby and to keep the initial meeting short and gentle. Since your child may be excessively curious, it’s also essential to teach them not to harm the pet.</p>

<p>Avoid feeding them at the same time. Keep your pet’s food bowl in a place where your baby cannot reach it to prevent the baby from accidentally putting their hand in the pet’s food.</p>

<p>Make sure that your baby does not have any allergies to pet hair, dander, or feces. Additionally, regular veterinary check-ups are crucial for your pet’s health.</p>

<h1 id="playtime-for-your-child-with-pets">Playtime for Your Child with Pets</h1>

<p>Admit it, you can be busy and tired sometimes, juggling with a lot of responsibilities. Playing with your baby may not always be on your mind, especially when things don’t go as planned. So, how is your child’s playtime affected by having a pet at home?</p>

<p>First of all, when it comes to dogs, babies can find ready-to-run and jump partners as they grow. This activity can provide great companionship and make your baby’s playtime more enjoyable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cats are accustomed to the calm behavior of adults rather than the active and sometimes rough movements of children.

<p>Reading to babies is often considered an unnecessary activity by many parents. There is a misconception that babies won’t understand what they hear during this process and that it won’t stay in their memories.</p>

<p>However, it’s crucial to know that all the sensory stimuli surrounding the baby, including sounds, smells, tastes, colors, shapes, and touch, begin to imprint on their brains from the moment they are born. Stimulated brain cells interact with each other, forming various connections. These connections actually lay the foundation for your baby’s brain capacity throughout their life.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are other benefits to reading to babies. Let’s take a look at them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It helps your baby enjoy quality time with you.</li>
  <li>Regular reading, especially after meals or before bedtime, can soothe and relax your baby.</li>
  <li>It’s a great way for fathers to bond with their babies. While a father may not breastfeed, reading with a soft voice while holding the baby can establish a connection.</li>
  <li>Your baby learns to listen.</li>
  <li>Words spoken loudly and repeatedly contribute to your baby’s language acquisition.</li>
  <li>Watching you while you read helps your baby learn facial expressions and mimic them.</li>
  <li>Making book reading a routine can make it easier for your baby to continue this habit as they grow.</li>
  <li>In the long run, it fosters imagination, creativity, and a broader vocabulary.</li>
  <li>Picture books aid in the development of your child’s visual memory.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="when-should-you-start-reading-to-your-baby">When Should You Start Reading to Your Baby?</h1>

<p>You can begin reading to your baby from around the 6th month. The 6th month is a significant milestone in your baby’s development. By this time, your baby can hold their head up, sit comfortably in your lap, and their attention span has improved, making it an ideal time to start reading.</p>

<h1 id="what-to-consider-when-choosing-baby-books">What to Consider When Choosing Baby Books?</h1>

<p>When choosing the first book for your baby, it should have thick pages, short sentences, and minimal text.</p>

<p>Baby books should be colorful with simple and uncluttered illustrations.</p>

<p>The content should be age-appropriate, avoiding concepts that your baby won’t understand.</p>

<p>It should contain concrete but meaningful expressions, making baby stories a good choice.</p>

<p>Texture and tactile elements like raised surfaces or textures (e.g., felt books) can be appealing.</p>

<h1 id="tips-for-reading-to-your-baby">Tips for Reading to Your Baby</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the right time for reading. For example, a suitable time could be when your baby’s belly is full, their diaper is clean, and they are comfortable.</li>
  <li>While reading, avoid multitasking both physically and mentally. Activities like answering the phone and thinking about dinner can disrupt your baby’s concentration.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to whether your baby is getting bored. If they become disinterested, it’s time to stop.</li>
  <li>Encourage your baby to look at the pictures and say what they are.</li>
  <li>When explaining the pictures, use your finger to point.</li>
  <li>While reading the book, use your body and voice in line with the images. For example, if a dog is barking in the book, bark in a similar way.</li>
  <li>Allow your baby to hold the book, put it in their mouth, and turn the pages. Help them explore and get familiar with the book.</li>
  <li>If there’s a page that seems to catch their attention, spend extra time discussing it.</li>
  <li>Let your baby make choices. Show them different books and let them pick.</li>
  <li>You can also read rhymes, songs, and lullabies. They are attractive to your baby because they contain repetitive sounds and have a rhythm.</li>
  <li>Be patient and keep reading the same story even if it gets boring for you. It’s a fun activity for your baby.</li>
  <li>Your baby’s age, motor development, cognitive development, and your actions will influence your reading experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="babys-reactions-to-reading-at-different-ages">Baby’s Reactions to Reading at Different Ages</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>6-12 months:</strong> Reach for the book and grasp it. Sit upright in your lap. With adult assistance, they may turn the pages. They look at pictures and might prefer faces.</li>
  <li><strong>12-18 months:</strong> Can sit unsupported, carry the book, and turn pages. They may not immediately put everything in their mouths. Point at images and make sounds. They can turn the pages in the correct direction.</li>
  <li><strong>18-24 months:</strong> They carry the book, and you may find them offering it to you. They may recognize familiar pictures. If asked, they can point to figures. Their attention span varies and may be short.</li>
  <li><strong>24-36 months:</strong> They can find favorite pictures in the book and flip back and forth between pages. They may memorize all the words in the book and associate pictures with what they hear. They may form an attachment to a particular book.

<p>You can introduce this nutritious fruit to your baby starting at around 6 months of age. Begin by offering a small piece to your baby and observe for any allergic reactions. If there are signs of an allergy, consult your pediatrician and consider waiting until your baby is one year old.</p>

<h1 id="benefits-of-avocado-for-babies">Benefits of Avocado for Babies</h1>

<p>Avocado is a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including A, K, E, C, B6, magnesium, calcium, iron, potassium, and sodium. These nutrients can strengthen your baby’s immune system and enhance their ability to fight off diseases. Avocado is also easy to digest, making it a suitable choice for transitioning to solid foods.</p>

<p>Avocado is particularly high in unsaturated fats, which are considered to be similar to those found in breast milk. These fats are beneficial for your baby’s brain development. Additionally, its high fiber content can help alleviate constipation.</p>

<p>The fruit also boasts antioxidant properties, aiding in cell renewal and displaying anti-inflammatory effects. Its nutritious fats can have a positive impact on your baby’s liver health.</p>

<h1 id="when-to-eat-avocado">When to Eat Avocado</h1>

<p>It’s essential to consume fruits in their respective seasons. November and December are the prime months when avocados are at their ripest, offering a creamy texture.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-serve-avocado-to-babies">How to Serve Avocado to Babies</h1>

<p>For mothers introducing their babies to avocados for the first time, the question of “How to feed avocado to a baby?” frequently arises. Avocado’s soft and creamy texture makes it an ideal candidate for puree during the initial stage of introducing solid foods. Moreover, ripe avocados can be presented as finger foods since they can be easily mashed by your baby’s palate.</p>

<h1 id="how-often-to-offer-avocado-to-babies">How Often to Offer Avocado to Babies</h1>

<p>While avocado is a highly nutritious food for your baby, it doesn’t mean you should offer it every day. Diversifying your baby’s diet is crucial for the development of their taste buds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a 6-month-old baby, you can give about 2 tablespoons per day.</li>
  <li>For an 8-month-old baby, you can offer up to 4 tablespoons per day.</li>
  <li>For babies aged 9-12 months, a daily intake of 6-8 tablespoons of avocado is appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="selecting-ripe-avocados">Selecting Ripe Avocados</h1>

<p>Choose avocados that are dark in color. They should yield slightly to gentle pressure when you press your finger against them. If they are not ripe enough, you can let them ripen at room temperature among green apples.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Every baby’s development is unique, and this process can sometimes be challenging for parents. Your baby’s mobility and desire to explore are natural parts of their growth. In this article, we will provide more detailed information on when babies tend to be more active, how to establish routines during this period, how to approach it with more patience, and which toys can assist in your baby’s development.</p>

<h2 id="when-are-babies-more-active">When Are Babies More Active?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stages of Baby Development:</strong> Babies go through various stages of growth and development from birth onwards. Understanding how their mobility changes over time is important.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased Mobility:</strong> Babies typically become more active between 9 to 15 months. During this time, they learn to walk, become more curious about their surroundings, and show an increased interest in examining objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="establishing-and-managing-routines">Establishing and Managing Routines</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sleep Routine:</strong> Creating a regular sleep schedule for your baby can ensure better rest for both you and your baby.</li>
  <li><strong>Meal Times:</strong> The importance of setting regular and balanced meal times for babies and ways to develop healthy eating habits.</li>
  <li><strong>Play and Learning Times:</strong> Planning play and exploration times to channel your baby’s energy and support their mental development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approaching-with-patience-and-understanding">Approaching with Patience and Understanding</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Setting Boundaries for Babies:</strong> Babies begin to learn boundaries during this phase of exploration. Therefore, teaching them how to prevent negative behaviors is essential.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying Negative Behaviors:</strong> It’s important to identify examples of behaviors your baby should avoid, such as touching electrical outlets, approaching sharp objects, or climbing to dangerous places.</li>
  <li><strong>Using Gentle and Understandable Language:</strong> When addressing negative behaviors, using gentle and understandable language is more effective than a stern or frightening tone.</li>
  <li><strong>Offering Alternative Behaviors:</strong> When correcting an undesirable behavior, it’s important to provide your baby with an alternative activity. For example, redirecting their attention to another toy instead of touching an electrical outlet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toys-and-activities-tools-to-support-your-babys-development">Toys and Activities: Tools to Support Your Baby’s Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Educational Toys:</strong> Toys that enhance your baby’s motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and problem-solving abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Creative Games:</strong> Activities that stimulate your baby’s imagination and sensory perception.</li>
  <li><strong>Nature Walks and Park Time:</strong> Introducing your baby to the outdoors and encouraging physical activity to contribute to their development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="teaching-your-baby-what-not-to-do-teaching-boundaries">Teaching Your Baby What Not to Do: Teaching Boundaries</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baby’s Boundaries:</strong> Babies start to learn boundaries as they explore and discover the world. Therefore, it’s important to teach them how to avoid negative behaviors.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying Negative Behaviors:</strong> To set boundaries for your baby, provide specific examples of things they should not do, such as touching electrical outlets or approaching dangerous objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Using Gentle Language:</strong> When teaching your baby what not to do, use gentle and understandable language to communicate effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Offering Alternatives:</strong> Along with explaining undesirable behaviors, suggest alternative activities that your baby can engage in instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approaching-with-patience-and-understanding-1">Approaching with Patience and Understanding</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Calming Your Baby:</strong> If your baby persists in undesirable behavior, approaching them with patience and understanding to redirect their attention can be effective.</li>
  <li><strong>Repetitive Reminders:</strong> Learning boundaries may take time for your baby. Repeating and reinforcing specific boundaries with reminders can help.</li>
  <li><strong>Redirecting Attention:</strong> When your baby displays unwanted behaviors, redirect their attention to other activities or toys as a soothing approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion-supporting-your-babys-development">Conclusion: Supporting Your Baby’s Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Teaching your baby what not to do and establishing boundaries are essential for their safety and healthy development.</li>
  <li>Throughout this process, approaching it with patience, understanding, and love will assist your baby in growing and developing in a healthy manner.</li>

Adjust Breastfeeding Frequency</h2>

<p>The first answer to the question of how to increase breast milk supply is to not stop breastfeeding. Breast milk may not come immediately after childbirth. It will gradually come between 1-3 days, and it will increase as the baby breastfeeds. It’s important to breastfeed your newborn as often as they want. In the early days, a frequency of 8-10 times a day is normal. It is recommended to breastfeed the baby every two hours.</p>

<p>At first, the frequency of breastfeeding will be high but the duration of each session will be short because the baby will get tired quickly. As days go by, the frequency will decrease, and the duration will increase. From the third month onwards, the number of breastfeeding sessions will decrease to 4-5 times a day, and by the sixth month, it will be around 3-4 times.</p>

<h2 id="2-is-your-breast-ready-for-breastfeeding">2. Is Your Breast Ready for Breastfeeding?</h2>

<p>Being able to breastfeed without pain or discomfort ensures that your baby can latch on more comfortably. Problems such as cracks on the nipple, breast pain, or nipple obstruction can hinder breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Inability to breastfeed or emptying the breast can also reduce milk supply. In such cases, measures should be taken according to the nature of the problem. For example, you can massage the nipple to help it come out or use a breast pump.</p>

<p>Treating cracks with creams is also necessary. Depending on the nature of the problem, seeking professional help may be necessary.</p>

<h2 id="3-find-the-right-breastfeeding-position">3. Find the Right Breastfeeding Position</h2>

<p>Among the methods to increase breast milk supply, the most important is the breastfeeding position. Having the correct breastfeeding position allows the baby to latch on properly, which leads to better milk extraction. Therefore, the stronger the baby latches onto the breast, the more milk is released.</p>

<h2 id="4-ensure-complete-breast-emptying">4. Ensure Complete Breast Emptying</h2>

<p>One of the most critical factors for increasing milk supply is ensuring that the breast is completely emptied. Therefore, to increase breast milk production:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t offer the other breast if one breast hasn’t been completely emptied yet.</li>
  <li>Start the next breastfeeding session from the breast the baby last nursed from.</li>
  <li>If the baby can’t completely empty the breast or the milk supply is low, it’s important to express your milk with a breast pump after each feeding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-learn-how-to-use-a-breast-pump">5. Learn How to Use a Breast Pump</h2>

<p>Especially for new mothers wondering how to increase breast milk, the answer can often be found in using a breast pump. When used correctly, a breast pump can assist in increasing breast milk production.</p>

<p>If your baby is unable to breastfeed vigorously, a high-powered breast pump can stimulate milk production effectively.</p>

<p>There may be situations where you shouldn’t breastfeed. You might need to take certain medications while breastfeeding, and your doctor may advise against breastfeeding while on these medications. In such cases, you need to stimulate your body as if you were breastfeeding to maintain milk production.</p>

<h2 id="6-eat-foods-that-boost-milk-supply">6. Eat Foods That Boost Milk Supply</h2>

<p>During this period, it’s important to eat foods that increase breast milk supply.</p>

<h2 id="7-get-good-and-adequate-sleep">7. Get Good and Adequate Sleep</h2>

<p>We know, especially in the first days after childbirth, this may not be very possible, so we’ll say sleep as much as you can. It’s recommended that you sleep while your baby is sleeping. Try to avoid doing household chores, even small ones, during this period. Don’t hesitate to ask for help from your friends or family members.</p>

<h2 id="8-stay-calm">8. Stay Calm</h2>

<p>Adjusting to a new life is undoubtedly not easy. Moreover, everyone who enters and exits your home may have an opinion, such as “Ayşe’s daughter-in-law has plenty of milk because she drinks a lot of compote.” Comments from the environment like these might be discouraging.</p>

<p>Please don’t let such comments affect you. It happens to every new mother in our culture.</p>

<p>Try to focus on things that make you feel good. Listening to some beautiful music, reading a book for a while, or having a warm coffee with your friends are things that can make you feel good. You can allocate a few hours a week to these activities.</p>]]></content><author><name>admin</name></author><category term="Parenting" /><category term="Baby Care" /><category term="Breastfeeding Frequency" /><category term="Breastfeeding Position" /><category term="Emptying the Breast" /><category term="Using a Breast Pump" /><category term="Nutrition for Breast Milk" /><category term="Getting Adequate Sleep" /><category term="Stay Relaxed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[1.

<p>Newborn baby skin is quite sensitive. Compared to an adult, a baby’s skin is thinner and has less natural oil, making it prone to issues like dryness, flaking, and peeling when exposed to dry air or sunlight. So, if you’re wondering, “How can I protect my baby’s skin from the sun?” follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep your baby out of the sun as much as possible, even in winter.</li>
  <li>If your baby is under 6 months old, avoid using sunscreen.</li>
  <li>Ensure your baby stays in the shade.</li>
  <li>Use a hat to cover your baby’s neck and ears.</li>
  <li>Dress your baby in loose, lightweight clothing that covers their arms and legs.</li>
  <li>Avoid exposing your baby to the sun during the peak hours of UV radiation, which is between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, if possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding sunscreen use for babies under 6 months old and using sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15 for older children.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-babys-skin-moisturized">Keep Your Baby’s Skin Moisturized</h2>

<p>Newborns often experience skin dryness. Due to their time spent in a liquid environment in the womb and their adjustment to the dry air of the world, babies may develop dry skin. Additionally, their ability to retain moisture is not fully developed, which can lead to dryness, flaking, and peeling.</p>

<p>To prevent dryness in your baby’s skin, you can use water-based baby oil or baby lotion as recommended by your doctor. It’s advisable to repeat this process daily. If you’re wondering whether you can use olive oil to moisturize your baby’s skin, the answer is no, as olive oil is acidic.</p>

<p>When choosing baby skincare products (baby shampoo, baby soap, baby lotion, baby cream, baby detergent, etc.), opt for products specifically formulated for babies that are gentle, fragrance-free, and designed to be gentle on the skin.</p>

<h2 id="bathing-your-baby">Bathing Your Baby</h2>

<p>Another important aspect of baby skincare is determining how often to bathe your baby. Due to their sensitive skin and inability to regulate oil production effectively, newborns do not need to be bathed daily. It is recommended to bathe your baby no more than three times a week during the first year. Instead, you can gently clean your baby’s neck and joints daily with a damp cloth or cotton.</p>

<p>Using hot water during baths can lead to excessive drying of your baby’s skin. Therefore, use lukewarm water for your baby’s bath, and opt for baby skincare products that are specially formulated, fragrance-free, and pH-balanced to maintain your baby’s skin moisture.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-diaper">Choosing the Right Diaper</h2>

<p>Selecting the right diaper is crucial for protecting your baby’s skin, ensuring a good night’s sleep, and allowing comfortable movement. The choice of diaper can impact your baby’s skin pH balance, which may lead to diaper rash. Therefore, when choosing a diaper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opt for diapers with high absorbency that lock in moisture.</li>
  <li>Choose diapers designed with air channels and materials that allow the skin to breathe.</li>
  <li>Select soft and thin diapers.</li>
  <li>Follow the recommendations of pediatricians.</li>
  <li>Prefer a brand developed in collaboration with experts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, pay attention to proper diaper changing hygiene to prevent diaper rash. Avoid using alcohol-based or perfumed wet wipes, and opt for wet wipes that are free from alcohol and parabens, dermatologically tested, pH-balanced to preserve the natural skin barrier, and contain plant-based fibers for gentle cleansing.</p>

<h2 id="taking-care-of-babys-umbilical-cord">Taking Care of Baby’s Umbilical Cord</h2>

<p>The baby’s umbilical cord typically falls off within two weeks after birth. To prevent infection and ensure proper care of the umbilical cord, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow the diaper to fold down below the umbilical area.</li>
  <li>Ensure some air circulation by occasionally lifting the baby’s clothing.</li>
  <li>Keep the area dry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="selecting-baby-clothes-carefully">Selecting Baby Clothes Carefully</h2>

<p>Choosing the right baby clothing is crucial for preventing skin irritation. To keep your baby’s sensitive skin comfortable and irritation-free, consider the following when selecting baby clothes, blankets, and sheets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opt for soft, 100% cotton materials that don’t cause irritation.</li>
  <li>Choose seasonally appropriate clothing.</li>
  <li>Select clothing that allows your baby to move comfortably.</li>
  <li>Avoid clothing with excessive embellishments like feathers, lace, labels, or embroidery.</li>
  <li>Examine seams for rough edges or excessive thickness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If you’re a new parent, most of your questions may revolve around your baby’s nutrition. You might wonder, “How much should my baby weigh? Should I wake up a sleeping baby for breastfeeding at night? Why does my baby constantly want to nurse? When can my baby start solid foods?” We understand that you have these questions, and in this guide, we will provide you with essential information on what to focus on during your baby’s first 6 months.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-schedule">Feeding Schedule</h2>
<p>During the first 6 months, it is recommended to exclusively breastfeed your baby if possible. In the absence of breast milk, you can consult your doctor and consider using formula milk. Other than breast milk or formula, you should not introduce any other foods to your baby during this period (including water or fruit juice).</p>

<p>Every baby is unique, but one consistent fact is that breastfed babies get hungry more quickly compared to formula-fed babies. This is because breast milk is easily digestible and empties from the stomach much faster than formula milk. Therefore, it is natural for your baby to want to nurse frequently during the first months.</p>

<p>Your baby’s stomach size changes as they grow: It is cherry-sized at birth, walnut-sized by day 3, apricot-sized at the end of the first week, and egg-sized at the end of the second week. You can gauge whether your baby is satisfied by consistently weighing them and monitoring their daily wet diapers.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-routine">Sleep Routine</h2>
<h3 id="0-3-months">0-3 Months</h3>
<p>During this period, your baby can sleep well in your arms with skin-to-skin contact. Creating a calming environment that resembles the warmth, love, and conditions of the womb will comfort your baby. This can be achieved through your scent, gentle rocking, frequent nursing, swaddling to mimic the snug womb environment, and using white noise that mimics womb sounds.</p>

<h3 id="4-6-months">4-6 Months</h3>
<p>Babies grow rapidly during this stage, nearing the end of the newborn phase and beginning to adapt to the world. It’s important for your baby to gradually establish sleep routines, avoiding habits that you may have to break later on. These habits could include rocking, car rides, baby carriers, and constant carrying.</p>

<p>You can gradually reduce practices like rocking and white noise that you implemented during the first 3 months. Consistency and emotional support throughout this process will yield positive results.</p>

<p>Sleep is as crucial as nutrition for your baby’s development. Regardless of their age, babies require a calming routine for sleep to feel secure. While every baby is unique, many babies enjoy a pre-sleep bath and find it soothing. You can incorporate bath time into your baby’s bedtime routine.</p>

<h2 id="diaper-changes">Diaper Changes</h2>
<p>Learning to change your baby’s diaper and getting accustomed to it may take some time. Initially, you may be concerned about hurting your baby or making a mistake. However, with practice, you will become more confident in performing these tasks.</p>

<p>It is essential to prioritize your baby’s sensitive skin when choosing diapers and wet wipes. Uni Baby Newborn Wet Wipes, the first and only newborn wipe approved for naturalness in Turkey, with its 100% natural fibers and pure water content, gently cleanses your newborn’s skin without irritation.</p>

<h2 id="umbilical-cord-care">Umbilical Cord Care</h2>
<p>To promote quick healing of the umbilical cord, ensure it stays dry. Instead of direct washing, consider sponge baths for your baby in the early days. Keeping the umbilical cord exposed outside of the diaper can also help.</p>

<p>It is no longer recommended to use alcohol for cleaning the umbilical cord, in line with the World Health Organization’s guidelines. This approach allows the umbilical cord to dry faster.</p>

<h2 id="bathing-routine">Bathing Routine</h2>
<p>You can sponge bathe your newborn for the first few weeks. This is the safest way to clean your baby before the umbilical cord falls off.</p>

<p>After the umbilical cord heals, you can give your baby a bath in water. Initially, keep bath times short. Your baby might protest during the first few baths, but they will usually signal when they are ready.</p>

<p>For your baby’s sensitive skin, ensure that the products you use are hypoallergenic. Uni Baby Newborn Foam Shampoo and Body Wash can be applied gently to your baby with its formula containing 95% natural ingredients and pure water.</p>

<h2 id="skin-care">Skin Care</h2>
<p>A baby’s skin is delicate and prone to allergies. It’s crucial to choose hypoallergenic products for your baby. To protect your baby’s sensitive skin, follow these recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change your baby’s diaper frequently and consider using diaper rash creams.</li>
  <li>Avoid overheating your baby. (Babies often have cold hands and feet, but you can tell if they are too cold by feeling their neck.)</li>
  <li>If your baby’s skin becomes dry, you can moisturize it with Uni Baby’s baby oils.</li>
  <li>Opt for clothing and bedding made of cotton.</li>
  <li>Wash clothing that comes into prolonged contact with your baby’s skin with specialized products designed for sensitive and breathable fabrics. Uni Baby Newborn Liquid Laundry Detergent offers a natural formula that leaves no soap residue on your baby’s delicate clothes.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these guidelines, you can ensure your baby’s first 6 months are as comfortable and healthy as possible. Your baby’s well-being and comfort are a top priority, and these practices will help you provide the best care for your little one.</p>]]></content><author><name>admin</name></author><category term="Baby Care" /><category term="Baby Feeding" /><category term="Baby Sleep Routine" /><category term="Baby Diaper Change" /><category term="Umbilical Cord Care" /><category term="Baby Bathing" /><category term="Baby Skin Care" /><category term="Newborn Care" /><category term="Baby Feeding Schedule" /><category term="Baby Sleep Habits" /><category term="Baby Skin Sensitivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things to Pay Attention to in Your Baby’s First 6 Months]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.happymothersland.com/assets/images/baby-care-attention.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.happymothersland.com/assets/images/baby-care-attention.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>

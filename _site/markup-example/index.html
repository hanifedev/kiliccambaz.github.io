    "body": "2023/10/05 - 3-Month-Old Baby DevelopmentTwo big months have passed. You’re about to start enjoying delightful moments with your baby because they are now going to recognize you, smile, giggle, and discovering their hands and playing with them will be their greatest joy. If you’re ready, let’s begin reading about the development of a 3-month-old baby! 3-Month-Old Baby Development Chart: The answers to questions like “How much should a 3-month-old baby weigh?” or “How much should a 3-month-old baby’s height increase?” can be found in the table below:           Girl (average)   Boy (average)         3-month baby weight   5. 5 kg   6 kg       3-month baby height   59 cm   61 cm       3-month baby head circumference   39. 5 cm   40. 5 cm    Your 3-month-old baby continues to develop, much like the previous month.  They gain approximately 750 grams in weight and grow by about 2 cm in height.  During this time, your baby’s eyes might seem quite chubby, but don’t worry; this plumpness will gradually disappear as they start crawling and walking in the coming months. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Sensory Development: Vision at 3 Months: Your baby’s vision is rapidly developing. If you’re wondering, “How does a 3-month-old baby see?” you can say that they will start seeing the world much like you in a few months.  At the third month, your baby may focus both of their eyes inward to look at an object nearby and turn them outward to see something in the distance.  They can start seeing things at a distance and may recognize you even if there is some distance between you.  They will slowly begin to distinguish colors, with a particular interest in primary colors.  If you notice any issues like cross-eyes or wandering eyes in your baby’s vision during this month, it’s advisable to consult a doctor promptly. Hearing at 3 Months: Your baby’s hearing abilities have improved significantly. They can now react with excitement to familiar sounds or remain calm when they hear familiar voices. When they hear an unfamiliar sound, they might suddenly turn towards the source of the sound, trying to locate it. Taste and Smell at 3 Months:  Towards the end of this month, your baby will start to differentiate between different tastes.  They may discern the difference between breast milk and formula and react to it.  If you introduce a new type of baby food, they may recognize it as a foreign substance.  Unpleasant smells might trigger reactions.  All of these can influence your baby’s feeding preferences. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Cognitive Development: During this month, your baby will start to move consciously. They will raise their hands to examine them or reach for toys eagerly. All of these actions are driven by the development of motor skills, thinking, reasoning, and planning abilities. During this time, your baby’s brain starts to form memories and experiences. Repeated actions help create memory pathways. For example, they may learn that when they cry, you will respond with attention, or when they smile, you will smile back at them. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Social Development: Your 3-month-old baby will exhibit more sounds and facial expressions. They might coo, cry, babble, stick out their tongue, smile, and use these ways to try to communicate with you. If you wonder, “What does a 3-month-old baby enjoy?” you can say they love it when their actions get a response. By now, they know you and their father quite well, and they don’t have a fear of strangers yet. However, in a few months, they might not want to leave your side and may not be very friendly with strangers, so keep that in mind. During this month, your baby may cry not only to express their needs or emotions but also to seek attention. If you’re wondering, “Why does a 3-month-old baby cry?” don’t forget that seeking attention can be one of the reasons! What Can a 3-Month-Old Baby Do?: Your 3-month-old baby’s movements will progress faster than in previous months. They can now hold their head up better and even lift it to about 45 degrees. So, if you’re wondering, “Can a 3-month-old baby hold their head up?” the answer is yes. Although it will be several months before they start walking, when you support them on their feet, they might make stepping movements. But don’t rush; this is just a reflex! Your baby’s brain development seems to be making a leap this month. They will become more in tune with the real world and pay close attention to what’s happening around them. Especially when they hear your voice, they might directly look at you and even try to respond. By the third month, they will be aware of their hands. They will start exploring them, especially when lying down. They will examine their own hands with almost all fingers spread out, realize they can make a sound by clapping them together, and even manage to clasp their hands together. Toward the end of this month, they will learn that their hands can touch and move objects like toys. They will also realize that their hands are good for grabbing things and might try to shake objects, especially noisy toys. Once they learn this, it won’t be easy to take the toy away from them. The third month will continue with them putting everything they can into their mouths. You might wonder, “Why does a 3-month-old baby put their hand in their mouth?” The answer is simple: they are trying to explore everything with their mouths! The most delightful development this month is that they will start recognizing their loved ones more clearly. They will behave differently with you and your partner, recognize you immediately, smile more, cry less, and not want to be alone. As you can see, the behaviors of a 3-month-old baby are changing gradually! By the end of this month, your baby will be able to:  Cry less and smile more because their relationship with the outside world is improving.  Roll over on both their bed and play mat. But be careful not to leave small pieces on the play mat since they put everything in their mouths! Turn their head to see a slowly moving object and follow a close object up to 180 degrees.  Their reaction to strangers will become apparent this month. When someone unfamiliar holds them, they will first examine them, and if they realize they don’t know the person, they might start crying. 3-Month-Old Baby Toys: Toys play a significant role in the development of your 3-month-old baby! During this time when your baby is keenly observing the surroundings, eager to have fun, and their senses are fully engaged, toys can be beneficial for both motor skill development and having enjoyable moments! Toys that capture their interest in sounds and colors will be helpful. Here are some toy suggestions for a 3-month-old baby:  Rattles are suitable toys for your 3-month-old baby. Their sound will encourage interaction. When your baby shakes a rattle, they hear a sound and realize they can create it themselves! Soft toys with different textures and colors can help your baby’s sensory development.  Brightly colored toys and mobiles can catch their attention and stimulate their vision.  Mirrors are exciting for your baby because they can see their reflection. It’s an excellent way to encourage self-awareness.  Play gyms with hanging toys can be both fun and educational. Your baby can lie on their back and reach out for the toys, improving their motor skills.  Board books with large, colorful pictures are perfect for introducing your baby to the world of books. These toys will keep your baby entertained and help them develop their senses and motor skills. However, always supervise your baby during playtime to ensure their safety. Feeding a 3-Month-Old Baby: Feeding your 3-month-old baby will remain a crucial part of their daily routine. If you’re breastfeeding, continue to do so on demand, and if you’re using formula, follow the instructions on the package. At this stage, you might consider introducing a bottle if you haven’t already, as it can help your baby transition to bottle feeding if needed. Remember that every baby is unique, and their feeding needs may vary. Some 3-month-old babies might still wake up for nighttime feeds, while others might sleep longer stretches. Follow your baby’s cues and consult with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about their feeding habits or growth. 3-Month-Old Baby Sleep: By the time your baby reaches 3 months of age, you might notice some changes in their sleep patterns. While every baby is different, here are some general sleep patterns for a 3-month-old:  Your baby may start sleeping for longer stretches at night, typically around 5 to 6 hours at a time.  They might still take short naps during the day, ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours, with several naps throughout the day.  A consistent bedtime routine can be helpful in establishing good sleep habits.  Keep in mind that sleep regression can occur around this age, which might disrupt your baby’s sleep patterns temporarily. Ensure that your baby’s sleep environment is safe and comfortable, and always follow safe sleep guidelines to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). 3-Month-Old Baby Care Tips: As your baby continues to grow and develop, here are some care tips to keep in mind:  Continue with regular pediatrician check-ups to monitor your baby’s growth and development.  Practice tummy time daily to help strengthen your baby’s neck and upper body muscles.  Keep your baby’s environment clean and free from small objects that could be a choking hazard.  Maintain a consistent daily routine, including feeding, playtime, and naps, to provide stability for your baby.  Enjoy bonding time with your baby through cuddling, talking, and singing. These interactions are essential for their social and emotional development. Remember that every baby is unique, and they may reach developmental milestones at their own pace. If you have any concerns about your baby’s development or health, don’t hesitate to consult with your pediatrician. Conclusion: The third month of your baby’s life is filled with exciting developments in their sensory, cognitive, and social abilities. Enjoy this special time with your little one as they grow and explore the world around them. Remember to provide love, care, and support to nurture their healthy development. Before you know it, they’ll be reaching more milestones and growing into a curious and active baby. "

    "body": "2023/10/05 - Development of a 2-Month-Old BabyCongratulations, you’ve completed the first month with your baby! The second month promises to be more relaxed and experienced. Your baby’s sleep patterns are beginning to form, they’ll become more active, and you might even witness their first smile. Let’s explore what to expect in terms of feeding frequency, sleep routines, and the behavior of your 2-month-old baby, along with their sensory development. 2-Month-Old Baby Growth Chart: During the second month, your baby will continue to gain weight at a similar rate to the first few weeks, typically around 150 to 200 grams per week. Their cheeks, arms, and legs will start to fill out gradually. While the average weight for a 2-month-old baby is 4-5 kg, remember that each healthy baby may have different growth rates in terms of size and weight. The baby’s height may increase by approximately 1-1. 5 cm per month. The head and brain of your baby continue to develop at the same rate. The head circumference increases by about 1. 25 cm per month. It’s normal for the baby’s head to be larger than other body parts during this period, as the head continues to grow faster than other organs. The baby’s soft spot on the skull (fontanel) remains open but starts to harden and close slightly toward the end of the second month and the beginning of the third month. Sensory Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: Vision at 2 Months: In the second month, your baby’s vision becomes clearer and more vibrant compared to the previous month. You can now introduce them to pastel colors. Their improved vision means they will show more interest in bright and vivid colors. They will also examine your movements and speech with their eyes, so you might notice them vocalizing as a result. However, these sounds will consist of voiced consonants, as they have not yet mastered using their tongue for speech. This is completely normal, as babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age. Hearing at 2 Months: In the second month, your baby’s hearing becomes stronger than in the previous month. They will likely perceive your voice more clearly. You can even notice them becoming concerned if they don’t hear your voice for an extended period. They can distinguish between high-pitched and low-pitched sounds. For instance, they can differentiate between your voice and their father’s voice. You can gauge their responses by playing the same familiar melodies or reading the same story repeatedly. Since their hearing has improved, they will produce more sounds. Although these sounds will be mainly voiced consonants, there’s nothing to worry about. Babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age. Sense of Smell at 2 Months: Your baby has been exposed to various scents since birth, such as the smell of breast milk, your perfume, or the aroma of cooked chicken. As long as they don’t show sensitivity to smells, you can introduce them to other scents. Sense of Taste at 2 Months: At this stage, there’s no need to stimulate your baby’s sense of taste. They can only detect the taste of mother’s milk and bottle milk during this period. As they grow, exploring and tasting everything they find will become their way of researching the world. As long as these objects are not sharp or dangerous, it’s best not to intervene. Sense of Touch at 2 Months: The sense of touch is one of the most meaningful senses your baby uses to explore the world and understand how they should be touched. Try to understand how your baby prefers to be touched. Many babies enjoy being kissed, cuddled, or having their tummies tickled. There’s nothing better than hands filled with love. Expose your baby to different fabric textures and place them on different surfaces while lying on their stomach. Give them a massage for at least 20 minutes. Babies who receive massages gain weight more quickly and show better development. Infants who are not touched enough may experience growth delays. Mental Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: So far, your baby has been listening to and absorbing the conversations and sounds around them. Although they can’t vocalize their thoughts yet, they started understanding the meanings of words months before they began speaking. So, talk to your baby as much as possible. Look forward to those cooing and babbling sounds, which usually start between the 6th and 8th weeks. Your baby will eventually use their lips more effectively to create clearer sounds. This development in their tongue goes hand in hand with their motor skills. Social Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: Your baby will still spend most of their time sleeping. However, a 6-week-old baby can respond to your smiles with smiles in return. Responding positively to their smiles will help them realize that their actions have an effect, thus developing their ability to distinguish themselves from others. What Can a 2-Month-Old Baby Do?:  They can lift their body at a 45-degree angle when placed on their stomach. By the middle of this month, they may even lift their head at a 90-degree angle.  They start to explore and play with their hands.  They often engage with their hands and feet.  When an object is placed in front of them or given to them, they can begin to grasp it. They may attempt to bring small objects to their mouths and shake larger objects.  They can’t completely control their body movements yet, so it’s important not to leave them unattended on high surfaces.  They sleep less during the day and more at night.  They find joy in hearing their own voice and will make sounds frequently.  They can smile and make joyful cries.  They understand when they are being paid attention to.  They enjoy making sounds more than ever.  They can clearly recognize their mother’s voice.  They might even squeal with happiness.  Sucking can help calm them.  When they cry, especially when you hold them, they can calm down. Toys for a 2-Month-Old Baby: Since your baby will stay awake for longer periods, they will benefit from simple, safe, and colorful toys that help them improve their hand-eye coordination. Here are some suitable toys:  Rattles: These are great for stimulating your baby’s sense of hearing.  Mobiles: Hanging mobiles with colorful and contrasting objects can grab your baby’s attention.  Soft Toys: Soft, plush toys with different textures can be comforting and engaging.  Play Mats: These have hanging toys that encourage reaching and swatting.  Mirror Toys: Babies are fascinated by their own reflection.  Black and White Books: These high-contrast books are visually stimulating for infants.  Sensory Balls: Soft balls with textures for tactile stimulation. Remember that at this age, your baby will primarily enjoy looking at, listening to, and touching toys rather than actively playing with them. Keep safety in mind when selecting toys, ensuring there are no small parts that could be a choking hazard. Conclusion: The second month of your baby’s life is a period of rapid development, both physically and mentally. They are becoming more alert, responsive, and interactive. As a parent, continue to provide love, care, and attention to support their growth and well-being. Every baby is unique, so be sure to consult with your pediatrician if you have any specific concerns about your baby’s development. "

    "title": "1-Month-Old Baby Development: Milestones, Reflexes, and Care",
    "body": "2023/10/05 - 1 Month Old Baby Development: Milestones, Reflexes, and CareAfter a long pregnancy and the birthing process, you have finally met your precious baby. The time of tracking your pregnancy week by week is over, and now we will explore your baby’s growth, nutrition, movements, emotional development, and cognitive abilities on a monthly basis. Don’t underestimate the changes that can occur in the first month. Be prepared for new discoveries every day. Let’s delve into the development of a 1-month-old baby!  Your baby loses the excess fluid present in their body at birth, which means they might weigh slightly less than their birth weight when they come home. Don’t worry; in 1-month-old babies, weight gain typically increases within 10 days to 2 weeks.  During the first two weeks, your baby grows rapidly. As they gain weight, their height also increases. At the end of the first month, your baby will have grown approximately 4-5 cm.  The size of your baby’s head is important because it reflects the growth rate of their brain. In the early months, both the brain and the skull of your baby grow rapidly. While the baby’s head accounts for 20% of their body weight at birth, it will only represent 2% in adulthood. Consult a doctor for information on your baby’s head growth during the first month. 1-Month-Old Baby Reflexes:    Sucking Reflex: This reflex is a habit acquired by the baby while in the womb. You can observe that when you bring your finger, a bottle, a pacifier, or your breast close to their cheek, they will turn their head and mouth in that direction.     Moro Reflex: This reflex is observed in the development of a 1-month-old baby. It is an immediate response to a specific stimulus. It often occurs when the baby’s head suddenly changes position or when startled by a loud noise. In response, the baby raises their hands and feet, extends their neck, and may quiver their chin.     Tonic Neck Reflex: An interesting reflex is the tonic neck reflex. When your baby’s head turns in one direction, the arm on that side straightens, while the other arm bends.     Stepping Reflex: Another reflex your baby has is the stepping reflex. When you lift your baby under their armpits, they may appear to take steps or walk. This is called the stepping reflex. However, it’s a movement they will forget around 4 months old but will relearn after crawling.     Grasp Reflex: If you bring your finger close to your baby’s hand, they can quickly grasp it and pull it up. However, as with other 1-month-old baby reflexes, this reflex will change and gradually disappear as your baby develops more control, usually around the 3rd or 4th month.  Let’s see when these reflexes begin and end: These reflexes are related to both fine and gross motor skills. If you want to see more details about motor development in children, you can explore “Fine and Gross Motor Development in Children. ” 1-Month-Old Baby’s Sensory Development: Vision at 1 Month:  You may wonder, “When do babies start to see?” Well, they start seeing almost immediately, but only at short distances! In the first month, they have a visual range of only 15 to 30 cm. Don’t worry; this distance won’t prevent them from seeing you while they breastfeed. Allow them to study and recognize you.  If you’re curious about how a 1-month-old baby sees, it’s worth noting that they see distant objects as blurry, but their vision improves over time.  Dark-colored objects usually catch their attention. To engage them, introduce dark and brightly colored objects within their line of sight.  When you bring objects closer to their visual range, they can track them for a short period. Hearing at 1 Month:  Although their visual sense is still developing, 1-month-old babies are sensitive to human voices, especially yours.  Since they heard your voice the most while in the womb, it’s natural for a 1-month-old baby to recognize you and respond when they hear your voice. Seize this opportunity to comfort them and engage in conversations. Smell at 1 Month:  Babies have a well-developed sense of smell at birth and can quickly distinguish the smell of your breast milk.  Towards the end of this month, you may notice their preference for sweet scents like vanilla or banana, but they may dislike strong odors like alcohol or vinegar. Taste at 1 Month:  It might surprise you, but newborns have more taste buds than you! That’s why your baby might be selective about different tastes, including the warmth of your breast milk or formula. Touch at 1 Month:  Your baby’s sense of touch is also well-developed.  They prefer smooth surfaces and may not like the sensation of different materials simultaneously touching their skin.  They can also feel pain and may react when touched. Cognitive Development at 1 Month:  Your baby’s brain has been producing approximately 250,000 new brain cells per minute since your pregnancy. By the time they are born, they have created almost all the cells they will use throughout their life.  However, this is just the beginning. As your baby grows and explores the new world, their brain cells will start forming connections called synapses, laying the foundation for various skills.  You might think it’s too early to contribute to their brain development, especially in areas like language. However, that’s not the case. Talking to them, even though they can’t respond with words yet, is incredibly valuable. Reading aloud to them is also an excellent way to support language development.  Your baby has some ways to communicate and express themselves, even if they can’t talk. One of these is crying. Unless there’s an underlying health issue, why does a 1-month-old baby cry? It’s mainly for three reasons: hunger, sleepiness, or discomfort. Responding to their cries by addressing these needs is crucial in building trust and security. Feeding a 1-Month-Old Baby:  Your baby is primarily fed with breast milk or formula at this stage. Breastfeeding provides essential nutrients and helps strengthen their immune system.  Newborns usually feed every 2-3 hours, and it’s essential to feed them on demand. Pay attention to your baby’s cues, such as rooting, sucking on their hands, or crying, which may indicate hunger.  Feeding should be a relaxed and comfortable experience for both you and your baby. Ensure a comfortable feeding position, and burp your baby gently after each feeding to prevent gas.  Consult with a healthcare professional or lactation consultant if you have any breastfeeding concerns or issues.  If you’re using formula, follow the recommended guidelines for preparing and feeding formula milk. Sleeping a 1-Month-Old Baby:  Sleep is a crucial aspect of your baby’s development. Newborns sleep a lot, typically 14-17 hours a day. However, their sleep patterns can be quite irregular during the first few months.  Babies often wake up during the night to feed and have their diapers changed. Make sure their sleep environment is safe and comfortable, with no loose bedding or toys in the crib.  To help establish a day-night sleep routine, keep the room dark and quiet during nighttime feedings and diaper changes. During the day, allow natural light into their environment.

It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.

Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key.

    "body": "2019/01/18 - Bucharest’s history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

			<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Something.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

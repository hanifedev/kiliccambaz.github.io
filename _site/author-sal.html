    "body": "2023/10/09 - Baby’s Mobility and Exploration Desire: A Normal Developmental PhaseIntroduction: Every baby’s development is unique, and this process can sometimes be challenging for parents. Your baby’s mobility and desire to explore are natural parts of their growth. In this article, we will provide more detailed information on when babies tend to be more active, how to establish routines during this period, how to approach it with more patience, and which toys can assist in your baby’s development. When Are Babies More Active?:  Stages of Baby Development: Babies go through various stages of growth and development from birth onwards. Understanding how their mobility changes over time is important.  Increased Mobility: Babies typically become more active between 9 to 15 months. During this time, they learn to walk, become more curious about their surroundings, and show an increased interest in examining objects. Establishing and Managing Routines:  Sleep Routine: Creating a regular sleep schedule for your baby can ensure better rest for both you and your baby.  Meal Times: The importance of setting regular and balanced meal times for babies and ways to develop healthy eating habits.  Play and Learning Times: Planning play and exploration times to channel your baby’s energy and support their mental development. Approaching with Patience and Understanding:  Setting Boundaries for Babies: Babies begin to learn boundaries during this phase of exploration. Therefore, teaching them how to prevent negative behaviors is essential.  Identifying Negative Behaviors: It’s important to identify examples of behaviors your baby should avoid, such as touching electrical outlets, approaching sharp objects, or climbing to dangerous places.  Using Gentle and Understandable Language: When addressing negative behaviors, using gentle and understandable language is more effective than a stern or frightening tone.  Offering Alternative Behaviors: When correcting an undesirable behavior, it’s important to provide your baby with an alternative activity. For example, redirecting their attention to another toy instead of touching an electrical outlet. Toys and Activities: Tools to Support Your Baby’s Development:  Educational Toys: Toys that enhance your baby’s motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and problem-solving abilities.  Creative Games: Activities that stimulate your baby’s imagination and sensory perception.  Nature Walks and Park Time: Introducing your baby to the outdoors and encouraging physical activity to contribute to their development. Teaching Your Baby What Not to Do: Teaching Boundaries:  Baby’s Boundaries: Babies start to learn boundaries as they explore and discover the world. Therefore, it’s important to teach them how to avoid negative behaviors.  Identifying Negative Behaviors: To set boundaries for your baby, provide specific examples of things they should not do, such as touching electrical outlets or approaching dangerous objects.  Using Gentle Language: When teaching your baby what not to do, use gentle and understandable language to communicate effectively.  Offering Alternatives: Along with explaining undesirable behaviors, suggest alternative activities that your baby can engage in instead. Approaching with Patience and Understanding:  Calming Your Baby: If your baby persists in undesirable behavior, approaching them with patience and understanding to redirect their attention can be effective.  Repetitive Reminders: Learning boundaries may take time for your baby. Repeating and reinforcing specific boundaries with reminders can help.  Redirecting Attention: When your baby displays unwanted behaviors, redirect their attention to other activities or toys as a soothing approach. Conclusion: Supporting Your Baby’s Development:  Teaching your baby what not to do and establishing boundaries are essential for their safety and healthy development.  Throughout this process, approaching it with patience, understanding, and love will assist your baby in growing and developing in a healthy manner. "

    "title": "Things to Pay Attention to in Your Baby's First 6 Months",
    "body": "2023/10/06 - Things to Pay Attention to in Your Baby’s First 6 MonthsIntroduction: If you’re a new parent, most of your questions may revolve around your baby’s nutrition. You might wonder, “How much should my baby weigh? Should I wake up a sleeping baby for breastfeeding at night? Why does my baby constantly want to nurse? When can my baby start solid foods?” We understand that you have these questions, and in this guide, we will provide you with essential information on what to focus on during your baby’s first 6 months. Feeding Schedule: During the first 6 months, it is recommended to exclusively breastfeed your baby if possible. In the absence of breast milk, you can consult your doctor and consider using formula milk. Other than breast milk or formula, you should not introduce any other foods to your baby during this period (including water or fruit juice). Every baby is unique, but one consistent fact is that breastfed babies get hungry more quickly compared to formula-fed babies. This is because breast milk is easily digestible and empties from the stomach much faster than formula milk. Therefore, it is natural for your baby to want to nurse frequently during the first months. Your baby’s stomach size changes as they grow: It is cherry-sized at birth, walnut-sized by day 3, apricot-sized at the end of the first week, and egg-sized at the end of the second week. You can gauge whether your baby is satisfied by consistently weighing them and monitoring their daily wet diapers. Sleep Routine: 0-3 Months: During this period, your baby can sleep well in your arms with skin-to-skin contact. Creating a calming environment that resembles the warmth, love, and conditions of the womb will comfort your baby. This can be achieved through your scent, gentle rocking, frequent nursing, swaddling to mimic the snug womb environment, and using white noise that mimics womb sounds. 4-6 Months: Babies grow rapidly during this stage, nearing the end of the newborn phase and beginning to adapt to the world. It’s important for your baby to gradually establish sleep routines, avoiding habits that you may have to break later on. These habits could include rocking, car rides, baby carriers, and constant carrying. You can gradually reduce practices like rocking and white noise that you implemented during the first 3 months. Consistency and emotional support throughout this process will yield positive results. Sleep is as crucial as nutrition for your baby’s development. Regardless of their age, babies require a calming routine for sleep to feel secure. While every baby is unique, many babies enjoy a pre-sleep bath and find it soothing. You can incorporate bath time into your baby’s bedtime routine. Diaper Changes: Learning to change your baby’s diaper and getting accustomed to it may take some time. Initially, you may be concerned about hurting your baby or making a mistake. However, with practice, you will become more confident in performing these tasks. It is essential to prioritize your baby’s sensitive skin when choosing diapers and wet wipes. Uni Baby Newborn Wet Wipes, the first and only newborn wipe approved for naturalness in Turkey, with its 100% natural fibers and pure water content, gently cleanses your newborn’s skin without irritation. Umbilical Cord Care: To promote quick healing of the umbilical cord, ensure it stays dry. Instead of direct washing, consider sponge baths for your baby in the early days. Keeping the umbilical cord exposed outside of the diaper can also help. It is no longer recommended to use alcohol for cleaning the umbilical cord, in line with the World Health Organization’s guidelines. This approach allows the umbilical cord to dry faster. Bathing Routine: You can sponge bathe your newborn for the first few weeks. This is the safest way to clean your baby before the umbilical cord falls off. After the umbilical cord heals, you can give your baby a bath in water. Initially, keep bath times short. Your baby might protest during the first few baths, but they will usually signal when they are ready. For your baby’s sensitive skin, ensure that the products you use are hypoallergenic. Uni Baby Newborn Foam Shampoo and Body Wash can be applied gently to your baby with its formula containing 95% natural ingredients and pure water. Skin Care: A baby’s skin is delicate and prone to allergies. It’s crucial to choose hypoallergenic products for your baby. To protect your baby’s sensitive skin, follow these recommendations:  Change your baby’s diaper frequently and consider using diaper rash creams.  Avoid overheating your baby. (Babies often have cold hands and feet, but you can tell if they are too cold by feeling their neck. ) If your baby’s skin becomes dry, you can moisturize it with Uni Baby’s baby oils.  Opt for clothing and bedding made of cotton.  Wash clothing that comes into prolonged contact with your baby’s skin with specialized products designed for sensitive and breathable fabrics. Uni Baby Newborn Liquid Laundry Detergent offers a natural formula that leaves no soap residue on your baby’s delicate clothes. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your baby’s first 6 months are as comfortable and healthy as possible.

    "title": "How to Increase Breast Milk Supply: 8 Steps",
    "body": "2023/10/06 - 1. Adjust Breastfeeding Frequency: The first answer to the question of how to increase breast milk supply is to not stop breastfeeding. Breast milk may not come immediately after childbirth. It will gradually come between 1-3 days, and it will increase as the baby breastfeeds. It’s important to breastfeed your newborn as often as they want. In the early days, a frequency of 8-10 times a day is normal. It is recommended to breastfeed the baby every two hours. At first, the frequency of breastfeeding will be high but the duration of each session will be short because the baby will get tired quickly. As days go by, the frequency will decrease, and the duration will increase. From the third month onwards, the number of breastfeeding sessions will decrease to 4-5 times a day, and by the sixth month, it will be around 3-4 times. 2. Is Your Breast Ready for Breastfeeding?: Being able to breastfeed without pain or discomfort ensures that your baby can latch on more comfortably. Problems such as cracks on the nipple, breast pain, or nipple obstruction can hinder breastfeeding. Inability to breastfeed or emptying the breast can also reduce milk supply. In such cases, measures should be taken according to the nature of the problem. For example, you can massage the nipple to help it come out or use a breast pump. Treating cracks with creams is also necessary. Depending on the nature of the problem, seeking professional help may be necessary. 3. Find the Right Breastfeeding Position: Among the methods to increase breast milk supply, the most important is the breastfeeding position. Having the correct breastfeeding position allows the baby to latch on properly, which leads to better milk extraction. Therefore, the stronger the baby latches onto the breast, the more milk is released. 4. Ensure Complete Breast Emptying: One of the most critical factors for increasing milk supply is ensuring that the breast is completely emptied. Therefore, to increase breast milk production:  Don’t offer the other breast if one breast hasn’t been completely emptied yet.  Start the next breastfeeding session from the breast the baby last nursed from.  If the baby can’t completely empty the breast or the milk supply is low, it’s important to express your milk with a breast pump after each feeding. 5. Learn How to Use a Breast Pump: Especially for new mothers wondering how to increase breast milk, the answer can often be found in using a breast pump. When used correctly, a breast pump can assist in increasing breast milk production. If your baby is unable to breastfeed vigorously, a high-powered breast pump can stimulate milk production effectively. There may be situations where you shouldn’t breastfeed. You might need to take certain medications while breastfeeding, and your doctor may advise against breastfeeding while on these medications. In such cases, you need to stimulate your body as if you were breastfeeding to maintain milk production. 6. Eat Foods That Boost Milk Supply: During this period, it’s important to eat foods that increase breast milk supply. 7. Get Good and Adequate Sleep: We know, especially in the first days after childbirth, this may not be very possible, so we’ll say sleep as much as you can. It’s recommended that you sleep while your baby is sleeping. Try to avoid doing household chores, even small ones, during this period. Don’t hesitate to ask for help from your friends or family members. 8. Stay Calm: Adjusting to a new life is undoubtedly not easy. Moreover, everyone who enters and exits your home may have an opinion, such as “Ayşe’s daughter-in-law has plenty of milk because she drinks a lot of compote. ” Comments from the environment like these might be discouraging. Please don’t let such comments affect you. It happens to every new mother in our culture. Try to focus on things that make you feel good. Listening to some beautiful music, reading a book for a while, or having a warm coffee with your friends are things that can make you feel good. You can allocate a few hours a week to these activities. "

    "title": "How to Care for Your Baby's Skin?",
    "body": "2023/10/06 - Protect Your Baby from the Sun: Newborn baby skin is quite sensitive. Compared to an adult, a baby’s skin is thinner and has less natural oil, making it prone to issues like dryness, flaking, and peeling when exposed to dry air or sunlight. So, if you’re wondering, “How can I protect my baby’s skin from the sun?” follow these steps:  Keep your baby out of the sun as much as possible, even in winter.  If your baby is under 6 months old, avoid using sunscreen.  Ensure your baby stays in the shade.  Use a hat to cover your baby’s neck and ears.  Dress your baby in loose, lightweight clothing that covers their arms and legs.  Avoid exposing your baby to the sun during the peak hours of UV radiation, which is between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, if possible. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding sunscreen use for babies under 6 months old and using sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15 for older children. Keep Your Baby’s Skin Moisturized: Newborns often experience skin dryness. Due to their time spent in a liquid environment in the womb and their adjustment to the dry air of the world, babies may develop dry skin. Additionally, their ability to retain moisture is not fully developed, which can lead to dryness, flaking, and peeling. To prevent dryness in your baby’s skin, you can use water-based baby oil or baby lotion as recommended by your doctor. It’s advisable to repeat this process daily. If you’re wondering whether you can use olive oil to moisturize your baby’s skin, the answer is no, as olive oil is acidic. When choosing baby skincare products (baby shampoo, baby soap, baby lotion, baby cream, baby detergent, etc. ), opt for products specifically formulated for babies that are gentle, fragrance-free, and designed to be gentle on the skin. Bathing Your Baby: Another important aspect of baby skincare is determining how often to bathe your baby. Due to their sensitive skin and inability to regulate oil production effectively, newborns do not need to be bathed daily. It is recommended to bathe your baby no more than three times a week during the first year. Instead, you can gently clean your baby’s neck and joints daily with a damp cloth or cotton. Using hot water during baths can lead to excessive drying of your baby’s skin. Therefore, use lukewarm water for your baby’s bath, and opt for baby skincare products that are specially formulated, fragrance-free, and pH-balanced to maintain your baby’s skin moisture. Choosing the Right Diaper: Selecting the right diaper is crucial for protecting your baby’s skin, ensuring a good night’s sleep, and allowing comfortable movement. The choice of diaper can impact your baby’s skin pH balance, which may lead to diaper rash. Therefore, when choosing a diaper:  Opt for diapers with high absorbency that lock in moisture.  Choose diapers designed with air channels and materials that allow the skin to breathe.  Select soft and thin diapers.  Follow the recommendations of pediatricians.  Prefer a brand developed in collaboration with experts. Also, pay attention to proper diaper changing hygiene to prevent diaper rash. Avoid using alcohol-based or perfumed wet wipes, and opt for wet wipes that are free from alcohol and parabens, dermatologically tested, pH-balanced to preserve the natural skin barrier, and contain plant-based fibers for gentle cleansing. Taking Care of Baby’s Umbilical Cord: The baby’s umbilical cord typically falls off within two weeks after birth. To prevent infection and ensure proper care of the umbilical cord, follow these guidelines:  Allow the diaper to fold down below the umbilical area.  Ensure some air circulation by occasionally lifting the baby’s clothing.  Keep the area dry. Selecting Baby Clothes Carefully: Choosing the right baby clothing is crucial for preventing skin irritation. To keep your baby’s sensitive skin comfortable and irritation-free, consider the following when selecting baby clothes, blankets, and sheets:  Opt for soft, 100% cotton materials that don’t cause irritation.  Choose seasonally appropriate clothing.  Select clothing that allows your baby to move comfortably.  Avoid clothing with excessive embellishments like feathers, lace, labels, or embroidery.  Examine seams for rough edges or excessive thickness. Remember that baby skincare is essential for your baby’s healthy growth. Be mindful of the ingredients in skincare products and protect your baby from the sun, especially during the summer months. Choose clothing that is appropriate for your baby’s size and season, and avoid over-bathing your baby. Keeping these practices in mind will help ensure your baby’s skin stays healthy and comfortable.

    "body": "2023/10/05 - 3 Month Old Baby DevelopmentTwo big months have passed. You’re about to start enjoying delightful moments with your baby because they are now going to recognize you, smile, giggle, and discovering their hands and playing with them will be their greatest joy. If you’re ready, let’s begin reading about the development of a 3-month-old baby! 3-Month-Old Baby Development Chart: The answers to questions like “How much should a 3-month-old baby weigh?” or “How much should a 3-month-old baby’s height increase?” can be found in the table below:           Girl (average)   Boy (average)         3-month baby weight   5. 5 kg   6 kg       3-month baby height   59 cm   61 cm       3-month baby head circumference   39. 5 cm   40. 5 cm    Your 3-month-old baby continues to develop, much like the previous month.  They gain approximately 750 grams in weight and grow by about 2 cm in height.  During this time, your baby’s eyes might seem quite chubby, but don’t worry; this plumpness will gradually disappear as they start crawling and walking in the coming months. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Sensory Development: Vision at 3 Months: Your baby’s vision is rapidly developing. If you’re wondering, “How does a 3-month-old baby see?” you can say that they will start seeing the world much like you in a few months.  At the third month, your baby may focus both of their eyes inward to look at an object nearby and turn them outward to see something in the distance.  They can start seeing things at a distance and may recognize you even if there is some distance between you.  They will slowly begin to distinguish colors, with a particular interest in primary colors.  If you notice any issues like cross-eyes or wandering eyes in your baby’s vision during this month, it’s advisable to consult a doctor promptly. Hearing at 3 Months: Your baby’s hearing abilities have improved significantly. They can now react with excitement to familiar sounds or remain calm when they hear familiar voices. When they hear an unfamiliar sound, they might suddenly turn towards the source of the sound, trying to locate it. Taste and Smell at 3 Months:  Towards the end of this month, your baby will start to differentiate between different tastes.  They may discern the difference between breast milk and formula and react to it.  If you introduce a new type of baby food, they may recognize it as a foreign substance.  Unpleasant smells might trigger reactions.  All of these can influence your baby’s feeding preferences. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Cognitive Development: During this month, your baby will start to move consciously. They will raise their hands to examine them or reach for toys eagerly. All of these actions are driven by the development of motor skills, thinking, reasoning, and planning abilities. During this time, your baby’s brain starts to form memories and experiences. Repeated actions help create memory pathways. For example, they may learn that when they cry, you will respond with attention, or when they smile, you will smile back at them. 3-Month-Old Baby’s Social Development: Your 3-month-old baby will exhibit more sounds and facial expressions. They might coo, cry, babble, stick out their tongue, smile, and use these ways to try to communicate with you. If you wonder, “What does a 3-month-old baby enjoy?” you can say they love it when their actions get a response. By now, they know you and their father quite well, and they don’t have a fear of strangers yet. However, in a few months, they might not want to leave your side and may not be very friendly with strangers, so keep that in mind. During this month, your baby may cry not only to express their needs or emotions but also to seek attention. If you’re wondering, “Why does a 3-month-old baby cry?” don’t forget that seeking attention can be one of the reasons! What Can a 3-Month-Old Baby Do?: Your 3-month-old baby’s movements will progress faster than in previous months. They can now hold their head up better and even lift it to about 45 degrees. So, if you’re wondering, “Can a 3-month-old baby hold their head up?” the answer is yes. Although it will be several months before they start walking, when you support them on their feet, they might make stepping movements. But don’t rush; this is just a reflex! Your baby’s brain development seems to be making a leap this month. They will become more in tune with the real world and pay close attention to what’s happening around them. Especially when they hear your voice, they might directly look at you and even try to respond. By the third month, they will be aware of their hands. They will start exploring them, especially when lying down. They will examine their own hands with almost all fingers spread out, realize they can make a sound by clapping them together, and even manage to clasp their hands together. Toward the end of this month, they will learn that their hands can touch and move objects like toys. They will also realize that their hands are good for grabbing things and might try to shake objects, especially noisy toys. Once they learn this, it won’t be easy to take the toy away from them. The third month will continue with them putting everything they can into their mouths. You might wonder, “Why does a 3-month-old baby put their hand in their mouth?” The answer is simple: they are trying to explore everything with their mouths! The most delightful development this month is that they will start recognizing their loved ones more clearly. They will behave differently with you and your partner, recognize you immediately, smile more, cry less, and not want to be alone. As you can see, the behaviors of a 3-month-old baby are changing gradually! By the end of this month, your baby will be able to:  Cry less and smile more because their relationship with the outside world is improving.  Roll over on both their bed and play mat. But be careful not to leave small pieces on the play mat since they put everything in their mouths! Turn their head to see a slowly moving object and follow a close object up to 180 degrees.  Their reaction to strangers will become apparent this month. When someone unfamiliar holds them, they will first examine them, and if they realize they don’t know the person, they might start crying. 3-Month-Old Baby Toys: Toys play a significant role in the development of your 3-month-old baby! During this time when your baby is keenly observing the surroundings, eager to have fun, and their senses are fully engaged, toys can be beneficial for both motor skill development and having enjoyable moments! Toys that capture their interest in sounds and colors will be helpful. Here are some toy suggestions for a 3-month-old baby:  Rattles are suitable toys for your 3-month-old baby. Their sound will encourage interaction. When your baby shakes a rattle, they hear a sound and realize they can create it themselves! Soft toys with different textures and colors can help your baby’s sensory development.  Brightly colored toys and mobiles can catch their attention and stimulate their vision.  Mirrors are exciting for your baby because they can see their reflection. It’s an excellent way to encourage self-awareness.  Play gyms with hanging toys can be both fun and educational. Your baby can lie on their back and reach out for the toys, improving their motor skills.  Board books with large, colorful pictures are perfect for introducing your baby to the world of books. These toys will keep your baby entertained and help them develop their senses and motor skills. However, always supervise your baby during playtime to ensure their safety. Feeding a 3-Month-Old Baby: Feeding your 3-month-old baby will remain a crucial part of their daily routine. If you’re breastfeeding, continue to do so on demand, and if you’re using formula, follow the instructions on the package. At this stage, you might consider introducing a bottle if you haven’t already, as it can help your baby transition to bottle feeding if needed. Remember that every baby is unique, and their feeding needs may vary. Some 3-month-old babies might still wake up for nighttime feeds, while others might sleep longer stretches. Follow your baby’s cues and consult with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about their feeding habits or growth. 3-Month-Old Baby Sleep: By the time your baby reaches 3 months of age, you might notice some changes in their sleep patterns. While every baby is different, here are some general sleep patterns for a 3-month-old:  Your baby may start sleeping for longer stretches at night, typically around 5 to 6 hours at a time.  They might still take short naps during the day, ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours, with several naps throughout the day.  A consistent bedtime routine can be helpful in establishing good sleep habits.  Keep in mind that sleep regression can occur around this age, which might disrupt your baby’s sleep patterns temporarily. Ensure that your baby’s sleep environment is safe and comfortable, and always follow safe sleep guidelines to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). 3-Month-Old Baby Care Tips: As your baby continues to grow and develop, here are some care tips to keep in mind:  Continue with regular pediatrician check-ups to monitor your baby’s growth and development.  Practice tummy time daily to help strengthen your baby’s neck and upper body muscles.  Keep your baby’s environment clean and free from small objects that could be a choking hazard.  Maintain a consistent daily routine, including feeding, playtime, and naps, to provide stability for your baby.  Enjoy bonding time with your baby through cuddling, talking, and singing. These interactions are essential for their social and emotional development. Remember that every baby is unique, and they may reach developmental milestones at their own pace. If you have any concerns about your baby’s development or health, don’t hesitate to consult with your pediatrician. Conclusion: The third month of your baby’s life is filled with exciting developments in their sensory, cognitive, and social abilities. Enjoy this special time with your little one as they grow and explore the world around them. Remember to provide love, care, and support to nurture their healthy development. Before you know it, they’ll be reaching more milestones and growing into a curious and active baby. "

    "body": "2023/10/05 - Development of a 2-Month-Old BabyCongratulations, you’ve completed the first month with your baby! The second month promises to be more relaxed and experienced. Your baby’s sleep patterns are beginning to form, they’ll become more active, and you might even witness their first smile. Let’s explore what to expect in terms of feeding frequency, sleep routines, and the behavior of your 2-month-old baby, along with their sensory development. 2-Month-Old Baby Growth Chart: During the second month, your baby will continue to gain weight at a similar rate to the first few weeks, typically around 150 to 200 grams per week. Their cheeks, arms, and legs will start to fill out gradually. While the average weight for a 2-month-old baby is 4-5 kg, remember that each healthy baby may have different growth rates in terms of size and weight. The baby’s height may increase by approximately 1-1. 5 cm per month. The head and brain of your baby continue to develop at the same rate. The head circumference increases by about 1. 25 cm per month. It’s normal for the baby’s head to be larger than other body parts during this period, as the head continues to grow faster than other organs. The baby’s soft spot on the skull (fontanel) remains open but starts to harden and close slightly toward the end of the second month and the beginning of the third month. Sensory Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: Vision at 2 Months: In the second month, your baby’s vision becomes clearer and more vibrant compared to the previous month. You can now introduce them to pastel colors. Their improved vision means they will show more interest in bright and vivid colors. They will also examine your movements and speech with their eyes, so you might notice them vocalizing as a result. However, these sounds will consist of voiced consonants, as they have not yet mastered using their tongue for speech. This is completely normal, as babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age. Hearing at 2 Months: In the second month, your baby’s hearing becomes stronger than in the previous month. They will likely perceive your voice more clearly. You can even notice them becoming concerned if they don’t hear your voice for an extended period. They can distinguish between high-pitched and low-pitched sounds. For instance, they can differentiate between your voice and their father’s voice. You can gauge their responses by playing the same familiar melodies or reading the same story repeatedly. Since their hearing has improved, they will produce more sounds. Although these sounds will be mainly voiced consonants, there’s nothing to worry about. Babies typically start using voiceless consonants between 3 to 5 months of age. Sense of Smell at 2 Months: Your baby has been exposed to various scents since birth, such as the smell of breast milk, your perfume, or the aroma of cooked chicken. As long as they don’t show sensitivity to smells, you can introduce them to other scents. Sense of Taste at 2 Months: At this stage, there’s no need to stimulate your baby’s sense of taste. They can only detect the taste of mother’s milk and bottle milk during this period. As they grow, exploring and tasting everything they find will become their way of researching the world. As long as these objects are not sharp or dangerous, it’s best not to intervene. Sense of Touch at 2 Months: The sense of touch is one of the most meaningful senses your baby uses to explore the world and understand how they should be touched. Try to understand how your baby prefers to be touched. Many babies enjoy being kissed, cuddled, or having their tummies tickled. There’s nothing better than hands filled with love. Expose your baby to different fabric textures and place them on different surfaces while lying on their stomach. Give them a massage for at least 20 minutes. Babies who receive massages gain weight more quickly and show better development. Infants who are not touched enough may experience growth delays. Mental Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: So far, your baby has been listening to and absorbing the conversations and sounds around them. Although they can’t vocalize their thoughts yet, they started understanding the meanings of words months before they began speaking. So, talk to your baby as much as possible. Look forward to those cooing and babbling sounds, which usually start between the 6th and 8th weeks. Your baby will eventually use their lips more effectively to create clearer sounds. This development in their tongue goes hand in hand with their motor skills. Social Development of a 2-Month-Old Baby: Your baby will still spend most of their time sleeping. However, a 6-week-old baby can respond to your smiles with smiles in return. Responding positively to their smiles will help them realize that their actions have an effect, thus developing their ability to distinguish themselves from others. What Can a 2-Month-Old Baby Do?:  They can lift their body at a 45-degree angle when placed on their stomach. By the middle of this month, they may even lift their head at a 90-degree angle.  They start to explore and play with their hands.  They often engage with their hands and feet.  When an object is placed in front of them or given to them, they can begin to grasp it. They may attempt to bring small objects to their mouths and shake larger objects.  They can’t completely control their body movements yet, so it’s important not to leave them unattended on high surfaces.  They sleep less during the day and more at night.  They find joy in hearing their own voice and will make sounds frequently.  They can smile and make joyful cries.  They understand when they are being paid attention to.  They enjoy making sounds more than ever.  They can clearly recognize their mother’s voice.  They might even squeal with happiness.  Sucking can help calm them.  When they cry, especially when you hold them, they can calm down. Toys for a 2-Month-Old Baby: Since your baby will stay awake for longer periods, they will benefit from simple, safe, and colorful toys that help them improve their hand-eye coordination. Here are some suitable toys:  Rattles: These are great for stimulating your baby’s sense of hearing.  Mobiles: Hanging mobiles with colorful and contrasting objects can grab your baby’s attention.  Soft Toys: Soft, plush toys with different textures can be comforting and engaging.  Play Mats: These have hanging toys that encourage reaching and swatting.  Mirror Toys: Babies are fascinated by their own reflection.  Black and White Books: These high-contrast books are visually stimulating for infants.  Sensory Balls: Soft balls with textures for tactile stimulation. Remember that at this age, your baby will primarily enjoy looking at, listening to, and touching toys rather than actively playing with them. Keep safety in mind when selecting toys, ensuring there are no small parts that could be a choking hazard. Conclusion: The second month of your baby’s life is a period of rapid development, both physically and mentally. They are becoming more alert, responsive, and interactive. As a parent, continue to provide love, care, and attention to support their growth and well-being. Every baby is unique, so be sure to consult with your pediatrician if you have any specific concerns about your baby’s development. "

    "title": "1-Month-Old Baby Development: Milestones, Reflexes, and Care",
    "body": "2023/10/05 - 1 Month Old Baby Development: Milestones, Reflexes, and CareAfter a long pregnancy and the birthing process, you have finally met your precious baby. The time of tracking your pregnancy week by week is over, and now we will explore your baby’s growth, nutrition, movements, emotional development, and cognitive abilities on a monthly basis. Don’t underestimate the changes that can occur in the first month. Be prepared for new discoveries every day. Let’s delve into the development of a 1-month-old baby!  Your baby loses the excess fluid present in their body at birth, which means they might weigh slightly less than their birth weight when they come home. Don’t worry; in 1-month-old babies, weight gain typically increases within 10 days to 2 weeks.  During the first two weeks, your baby grows rapidly. As they gain weight, their height also increases. At the end of the first month, your baby will have grown approximately 4-5 cm.  The size of your baby’s head is important because it reflects the growth rate of their brain. In the early months, both the brain and the skull of your baby grow rapidly. While the baby’s head accounts for 20% of their body weight at birth, it will only represent 2% in adulthood. Consult a doctor for information on your baby’s head growth during the first month. 1-Month-Old Baby Reflexes:    Sucking Reflex: This reflex is a habit acquired by the baby while in the womb. You can observe that when you bring your finger, a bottle, a pacifier, or your breast close to their cheek, they will turn their head and mouth in that direction.     Moro Reflex: This reflex is observed in the development of a 1-month-old baby. It is an immediate response to a specific stimulus. It often occurs when the baby’s head suddenly changes position or when startled by a loud noise. In response, the baby raises their hands and feet, extends their neck, and may quiver their chin.     Tonic Neck Reflex: An interesting reflex is the tonic neck reflex. When your baby’s head turns in one direction, the arm on that side straightens, while the other arm bends.     Stepping Reflex: Another reflex your baby has is the stepping reflex. When you lift your baby under their armpits, they may appear to take steps or walk. This is called the stepping reflex. However, it’s a movement they will forget around 4 months old but will relearn after crawling.     Grasp Reflex: If you bring your finger close to your baby’s hand, they can quickly grasp it and pull it up. However, as with other 1-month-old baby reflexes, this reflex will change and gradually disappear as your baby develops more control, usually around the 3rd or 4th month.  Let’s see when these reflexes begin and end: These reflexes are related to both fine and gross motor skills. If you want to see more details about motor development in children, you can explore “Fine and Gross Motor Development in Children. ” 1-Month-Old Baby’s Sensory Development: Vision at 1 Month:  You may wonder, “When do babies start to see?” Well, they start seeing almost immediately, but only at short distances! In the first month, they have a visual range of only 15 to 30 cm. Don’t worry; this distance won’t prevent them from seeing you while they breastfeed. Allow them to study and recognize you.  If you’re curious about how a 1-month-old baby sees, it’s worth noting that they see distant objects as blurry, but their vision improves over time.  Dark-colored objects usually catch their attention. To engage them, introduce dark and brightly colored objects within their line of sight.  When you bring objects closer to their visual range, they can track them for a short period. Hearing at 1 Month:  Although their visual sense is still developing, 1-month-old babies are sensitive to human voices, especially yours.  Since they heard your voice the most while in the womb, it’s natural for a 1-month-old baby to recognize you and respond when they hear your voice. Seize this opportunity to comfort them and engage in conversations. Smell at 1 Month:  Babies have a well-developed sense of smell at birth and can quickly distinguish the smell of your breast milk.  Towards the end of this month, you may notice their preference for sweet scents like vanilla or banana, but they may dislike strong odors like alcohol or vinegar. Taste at 1 Month:  It might surprise you, but newborns have more taste buds than you! That’s why your baby might be selective about different tastes, including the warmth of your breast milk or formula. Touch at 1 Month:  Your baby’s sense of touch is also well-developed.  They prefer smooth surfaces and may not like the sensation of different materials simultaneously touching their skin.  They can also feel pain and may react when touched. Cognitive Development at 1 Month:  Your baby’s brain has been producing approximately 250,000 new brain cells per minute since your pregnancy. By the time they are born, they have created almost all the cells they will use throughout their life.  However, this is just the beginning. As your baby grows and explores the new world, their brain cells will start forming connections called synapses, laying the foundation for various skills.  You might think it’s too early to contribute to their brain development, especially in areas like language. However, that’s not the case. Talking to them, even though they can’t respond with words yet, is incredibly valuable. Reading aloud to them is also an excellent way to support language development.  Your baby has some ways to communicate and express themselves, even if they can’t talk. One of these is crying. Unless there’s an underlying health issue, why does a 1-month-old baby cry? It’s mainly for three reasons: hunger, sleepiness, or discomfort. Responding to their cries by addressing these needs is crucial in building trust and security. Feeding a 1-Month-Old Baby:  Your baby is primarily fed with breast milk or formula at this stage. Breastfeeding provides essential nutrients and helps strengthen their immune system.  Newborns usually feed every 2-3 hours, and it’s essential to feed them on demand. Pay attention to your baby’s cues, such as rooting, sucking on their hands, or crying, which may indicate hunger.  Feeding should be a relaxed and comfortable experience for both you and your baby. Ensure a comfortable feeding position, and burp your baby gently after each feeding to prevent gas.  Consult with a healthcare professional or lactation consultant if you have any breastfeeding concerns or issues.  If you’re using formula, follow the recommended guidelines for preparing and feeding formula milk. Sleeping a 1-Month-Old Baby:  Sleep is a crucial aspect of your baby’s development. Newborns sleep a lot, typically 14-17 hours a day. However, their sleep patterns can be quite irregular during the first few months.  Babies often wake up during the night to feed and have their diapers changed. Make sure their sleep environment is safe and comfortable, with no loose bedding or toys in the crib.  To help establish a day-night sleep routine, keep the room dark and quiet during nighttime feedings and diaper changes. During the day, allow natural light into their environment.  Your baby will develop a more consistent sleep schedule as they grow. 1-Month-Old Baby Care Tips:  Skin Care: Your baby’s skin is delicate and sensitive. Keep it clean and dry. Use a mild, fragrance-free baby soap and moisturizer if necessary.  Umbilical Cord Care: If the umbilical cord stump is still attached, keep it clean and dry. Avoid submerging your baby in water until it falls off.  Diapering: Change your baby’s diaper regularly to prevent diaper rash. Clean the diaper area gently with each change and use a diaper cream if needed.  Safety: Ensure your baby’s safety by babyproofing your home. Keep small objects, cords, and hazardous substances out of reach.  Immunizations: Stay on schedule with your baby’s immunizations as recommended by your healthcare provider. As your baby grows, you’ll witness numerous changes and milestones. Each month will bring new surprises and joys as you watch your baby’s development unfold. Embrace this incredible journey and cherish every moment with your 1-month-old baby. "
